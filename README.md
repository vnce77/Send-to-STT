Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our results presentation for your ending 31 May 2025. This has been a defining year for our business. We have reshaped Blue Label telecoms into Blue Label Unlimited, a streamlined future-fit digital platform solution business. This transformation reflects our commitment to reimagining value and building an empowered ecosystem that delivers access, connectivity and opportunity for all. Our shift to a more agile and integrated model gives us clarity, scale and focus to unlock new revenue streams and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. For investors, what does it mean? It means clarity through a simplified structure and clear strategic focus, scalability, a platform design for real-time, hard-demand growth and to unlock value whereby it's a reposition group that is set up to maximize returns. Why did we rebrand? Firstly, to eliminate market confusion about who we are and what we offer. And secondly, to showcase the full breadth and depth of the Blue Label ecosystem. Thirdly, to unite our people, partners and platform under one compelling identity. What this signals for our business is simplification through a clear integrated operating model, a modernized brand aligned with today's digital economy, platform thinking that enables agility, scalability and connected solutions. This is a foundation for our next growth chapter which we will unpack further for you in a short video. We live in a world seeking balance. That's why we're expanding beyond. Advancing as a proudly South African brand, illuminating new pathways, building networks and forging alliances, opening the way for everyone who thought it was closed. By being intentional, courageous, going where others are afraid to go, bettering what we've built to date. Through diverse digital solutions that serve all, united in our purpose to empower unlimited potential, through a transformative ecosystem of digital enablement, unlocking value for all our stakeholders. From our partners and investors, to all the lives we touch through the innovative solutions we deliver. Because we believe the sky is not the limit, it's simply the beginning of what's to come. We are blue label unlimited, blue unlimited potential. We have moved from a traditional holding company structure to an integrated ecosystem of seven buckets. Each solution buckets is powerful on its own but the real strength lies in the ecosystem effect, the way these solutions connect, scale and unlock value together. Importantly, our new structure gives us flexibility to consolidate, sell or RPI assets like SLC when the time is right, maximizing value for shareholders. Let me brief you walk you through our seven solution buckets. Blue label platform solutions, scalable secure and adaptable digital backbone powering products, services, payments transport, RIT and beyond. Blue energy solutions, streamlining municipal revenue collections through prepaid vending, rears recovery and assured bill payments while advancing scalable solar battery projects to unlock cash flows and deliver sustainable risk-free returns. Blue label distribution solutions, physical and virtual access to digital products and services delivered by an unraveled distribution network. Blue label media solutions, platforms and tools to monetize audiences through advertising content and engagement. Blue strategic decision making tools. Blue label training solutions, skills development and digital upskilling for employment and economic inclusion. Blue telco solutions, strategic telecoms play to enhance connectivity and financial inclusion. Together, these buckets create an ecosystem designed to scale faster, monetize smarter and capture growth across multiple verticals. We will now unpack each solution pillar providing a snapshot of performance and capabilities of each. On the Blue label platform solution, we have transitioned from a monolithic AON platform into our proprietary limitless cloud-based modular platform called Blue Scar enabling faster merchant onboarding, more products and improved uptime. It has been a major step for our technology evolution allowing greater scalability, stability and operational efficiencies across the business. We also are what labying our platform in order for our clients to market and manage their own products and services. A Blue Advanced platform using analytics to advance products and services. If you consider what is happening in the market today that 50% of all airtime sold today is to repair and advance. Our launch of emergency electricity top-up should bode well to help the industry and the market provide electricity in terms of need. Our proprietary transport solution called SMARTEP has been running since late last year in the PUTCO environment. It is an NF50-based solution which improves efficiencies, reduce fraud and works in an online and offline environment. There are an excess of 500 bus companies in South Africa where this solution could most aptly be fitted. We have two in the pipeline which we hope to announce in the not too distant future. Technovate delivers AR-powered IoT and extended reality solutions that tackle real world challenges in healthcare, education, training, mining and manufacturing. But blending advanced technologies with practical applications we transform complexity into opportunity. Moving on to the Blue Energy Solutions bucket as one of South Africa's largest prepaid electricity vendor we fuel financial inclusion by streamlining revenue collection. We ensure municipalities receive reliable, predictable cash flows while giving millions of residents seamless and equitable access to central services. The problem that we're dealing with currently in South Africa is the losses that are incurring between the supply and the distribution of electricity which we estimate between 300 and 400 billion rand a year. It is exacerbated by about another three billion rand of losses every single month. Out of that we estimate that 30% of all electricity that is bought is lost or stolen in the process, therefore compounding the already overburdened debt that the municipalities have. The solution we have is to secure prepaid vending and collection models which plug revenue leakage. Safeguards municipality cash flows and builds a bankable pathway to recovery and long-term sustainability. Our revenue assurance model is a no-risk model that we have designed for municipalities. We have a single baseline which we agree upon with the municipality. We will enter into the market looking for lost or stolen tokens of value. Not only does this fill a shortfall of cash flow in the municipality but we also provide employment and training for people in those regions. We label would then earn additional revenue on the new amounts that we found which is on a no-risk basis to the municipality. The only net loser out of this process is the people or persons that we catch who have stolen electricity. This model is scalable across nearly every municipality in South Africa. Not only trains people but also creates employment. There are major revenue assurance beds currently underway with both municipalities and Metro. Sea to Sea also has an RT 29 which is a transversal to supply smart meters to both metros and municipalities. We are one of only seven companies in South Africa to be appointed with an RT 29. On a geographical expansion and breakthrough on our RT 29 we completed projects in Bela Bela and Moda Milli and we have two new projects that we have been awarded in the Eastern Cape. Moving on to our renewable energy space, Blue Energy has built a model where we are able to build smaller capacities ranging from 10 to 20 megawatts directly into municipalities. We call it the nodal model which allows us to build smaller quantities in a more efficient, tarmius manner. We also allow for the municipalities in which we supply this electricity to purchase at a cheaper rate than they would from their traditional procurement. And also what we do do is allow them to not have so much concentration risk with one supplier. Our intention is to roll out a number of these over the coming years and building a cost-effective green energy solution to the municipalities we supply. Through blue, bold and blue energy solutions and our long-term relations of the AEM, we will deliver into and renewable projects from development and municipal integrations to operation and maintenance, thereby reducing Escom and stabilizing municipal revenues. Escom can then re-will or will that electricity that we are supplying to other desperate needs supplier to other municipalities. We have a significant growth power plant or a bus portfolio of identified municipalities already which would position Blue to roll out significant renewable capabilities supported by our advanced analytics and spade-ready projects. Our strategic partnerships are already in place, our main one with the Central Energy Fund SEF where we have a joint development agreement. We also have backers by specific funders and technical partners and Blue combines our revenue assurance, our funding muscle and technical expertise to fast track renewable deployment. Thank you. I now hand you over to Brett to take you through the remaining buckets in our future outlook. Thank you, Mark. Blue distribution solutions. We had a year where we delivered over 90 billion round in process transactions, reduced fraud losses, optimised voucher procurement and restructured around technology and branded vouchers for growth, maintained leadership despite intense competition supported by strong aggregator partnerships. Moving on to Blue Media Solutions, we expanded a fast-growing network of digital media touch points including transit and outdoor screens. We monetised everyday interactions from prepaid vouchers to communer routes into measurable media value. We delivered Harper targeted audience engagement through data-driven edtech and programmatic platforms. Onto our Blue Data and IR solutions. We harnessed one of South Africa's richest data lakes, profiling millions of consumers to drive new revenue streams. We leveraged AR for smarter credit risk modeling, behavioural prediction and lead generation. We established market leadership ambitions to be the most trusted data provider and number one lead supplier. Moving on to Blue Training solutions, we secured over 350 million round in UIF funding, creating more than 6,600 new jobs in the last 12 months, placed over 3,400 trainees into employment nationwide. We are scaling further with plans for an additional 10,000 positions supported by a world-class Randberg Training Centre. Moving on to our Blue Telco solutions, we improved portfolio quality through refined credit scoring and AR-driven fraud prevention. French housing, French housing underperforming stores with revamped outlets showing double-digit growth in acquisitions and renewals. Strategic priorities include channel expansion, stronger base management and value added service growth. CELSI. CELSI has completed a successful turnaround, stabilising operations, transforming to an asset-light model and restoring financial performance. Looking ahead, we are preparing for potential IPO. This would unlock shareholder value, enhance governance and give CELSI access to growth capital. For Blue Label, it offers multiple benefits, a chance to realise value from my investment at the optimal time, optionality to reinvest proceeds into higher growth digital solutions, ongoing exposure to CELSI's ecosystem through integration with our platforms, and a long-term shareholder position that ensures continuity and strategic influence. Turning to our financials, this year revenue grew to $14.1 billion with gross profit up 2% to just under $3.4 billion Rand. Our EBITDA increased strongly, up 31% to $1.6 billion, while our gross profit margin expanded from 22.6% to 24%. And core headline earnings per share rose sharply to $4.61, reflecting a year of strong underlying performance and discipline of execution. These results underline the resilience of our core business and the benefits of a leaner, more focused operating model. As we look forward, our focus is clear. Accelerate returns, driving revenue and margin growth from our core solution buckets, value creation, capturing integration benefits both vertically and horizontally, ecosystem engagement, deepening customer and partner relationships to drive stickiness and retention, strategic asset unlock monetising assets such as CELSI at the right time, targeted expansion moving into adjacent growth sectors such as renewables, IoT, data and fintech. We enter FY26 with strong momentum, a resilient balance sheet and a brand built for growth. In closing, blue label is now repositioned to business with a stronger operating model, sharper focus and bigger ambitions. Our goal remains consistent to be the most trusted and comprehensive enabler of digital and financial inclusion, delivering unlimited potential for all stakeholders. We would like to extend our gratitude to the board of blue label, as well as our staff, suppliers, customers and business partners for the ongoing support and dedication. I now hand you over to George Mendes in Elcoper, CEO and CFO of CELSI respectively, to share a brief update on the performance of CELSI. Thank you, Britt. Myself and Elr CFO will take you through the CELSI presentation, but of the agenda that we will follow today, the FY25 highlights, an operational review by myself, then a financial review by Elr and then focus areas looking forward for FY26. So, again, straight into the FY25 highlights, first and foremost, service revenue up 6% year-on-year, sustained momentum there across all of our priority segments, wholesale revenue up 13% year-on-year, MVNO partnerships really scaling the recurring income there, so performing very well, return to net profit and profit before tax of 200% increase year-on-year, our network quality is now second overall and we number one on 4G video experience in the country as performed by independent benchmark research, so really good movement taking place in the fiscal. The brand relaunch has been delivered and we are ranked in CANTOS top 30 brands in South Africa, so significantly performing well there, and then public market readiness is on track with all the foundations in place, so we think we're well positioned for that. Robust core performance that's taken us with double digit growth gains in some of the strategic focus areas, total net revenue up 4 points, EBIT up 5%, service revenue up a health 6%, prepaid revenue up 2%, prepaid broadband revenue 18%, gross income margin is up 5 points, wholesale revenue up 13 points, post-paid revenue up 2 points and mobile data traffic up 31% and blended Abu down by 2%. So a good set of results underpinning exactly what's happening and I'll unpack the operational review just to provide a little bit more colour, so this is our transformation journey really building for growth and that's really the foundation of what we want to do going forward, so first and foremost the brand repositioning, we've had a successful brand relaunch that's second place in the period, our sponsorship momentum continues to bode well, we have the shocks that's part of the sponsorship properties, we have the South African rugby legends as well as the comrades marathon association and we feel that's a good foot for the brand, the ultimate human race and in a way resembling Celsius journey, we are now number two on out-of-home presence, our social impact initiatives continue to bode well, we have goal code, we have take a child to work, our digital labs education facilities that we're building across the country, just to give a slight overview of what's happening in that space, the technology investments are voting really well, as I've said before we're now the best 4G video experience in the country and we're really proud of that achievement given where we've come from, we've been the first in Africa to deploy a cloud native multi-solution and that's gone really really well, we've implemented the next generation building system for prepaid and convergence and again it was done on time and within budget so we're very proud of that having taken place and we've now done the successful testing to offer the widest 5G coverage, we have not launched commercially yet but the integration has been done and the testing has been done so we're really well positioned for that. On value enhancements we're making sure that we've got compelling value propositions and product refresh in our total portfolio so we've launched the My Connector platform and that together with our CVM personalization has ensured that we've gone with a lot more activity below the line and personalization as opposed to above the line and open market pricing and customers are really enjoying the value that we are delivering through those platforms and our post paid portfolios also been fundamentally redone and we've got elevate plus propositions that are now voting well and delivering a lot more value to customers. Channel refresh and expansion, we really want to make sure that we've got improved customer touch points here and we've improved our distribution channels so on wholesale we've added a whole bunch of new partners from a retail perspective, we've added new channels as well really making sure that we can have presence where our customers need our presence. On the digital front we've made sure that we've launched now a new CELSI app and that's gone live and our customers are starting to enjoy the benefits of the app and we've also revamped 50 stores in our franchise environment so there's now 50 stores of the footprint that's been completely rebranded that our customers can enjoy the service offering in that new look and feel. On the MVNO leadership position we want to make sure that we remain the home of MVNOs and continue with that strong positioning with the MVNO category. Old Mutual Connect was launched in this period and is doing really really well we're quite pleased with the performance so far and then we want to make sure that we continue to report on the growth that's coming through from the other MVNO partners as this is a strategic priority for us. On the performance culture we've always had the ethos that we want to make sure they've got a high performance organization, high performance culture so this is underpinned by talent bench strength, we've employed a whole bunch of people in all the right areas to make sure that we've got the right skill set, we've deployed a whole bunch of training initiatives and programs to make sure that we retain this top talent and we continue to operate with great efficiency and really execute very very well. From a governance and transparency perspective we've made sure that we continue to increase and strengthen the transparency and the accountability from a rigor perspective, solid robust governance framework and systems that we've put in place and then a value driven leadership culture that has gone throughout the organization and then on the growth momentum we want to make sure that the positive trajectory with positive EBIT growth of 5% continues improved profitability has now been witnessed and we believe that public market readiness is now a good position for us. I'll now hand over to Elle. Thank you George. Hi everybody and welcome to today's presentation. I'm just going to take you through the financial review so you understand how we've performed. Looking at full performance from a revenue perspective we've split this between our growth service revenue and our net total revenue, the only reason being that our total net revenue is actually net our discounts and commissions and our service revenue is then more in line with what industry shows. From a service revenue perspective there's been good growth, 6% year and year that but in strategic areas we've seen some accelerated growth from that perspective. Our net revenue following on from total service revenue also grew but grew by a slightly lower amount by 4%. That reduction has been as a result of our reduced equipment revenue and just a reminder to everybody that for EFS purposes SLC we do not report equipment revenue for the post paid book so the only item you have here would be the service revenue for just the post paid book. Our EBITDA performance year and year looks fairly stable and is that sustainable? One thing that we do need to notice that there was a once of cost recovery in the prior of about 218 million which is why you can see that our EBITDA is looking fairly flat year and year but if you had to adjust that number there is quite a considerable movement year and year. If you then look at EBIT, EBIT movement has shown growth year and year or approximately 5% or EBIT margin a strong 14% and if you had to normalize the prior EBITDA number it would be closer to just under 1.3 billion. This performance from an EBITDA perspective has been driven by top line growth. It has also been driven by strong cost management throughout the process and managing our asset category. There has been a reduction year and year on our depreciation line. Looking at our net finance costs, our net finance costs are primarily driven by interest on our shareholder loans and our lease liabilities. In the financial year there was a reduction in our lease liabilities as we finalized our decommissionings that has then rolled into this new 2025 year and you're seeing a four-year implication that has led to the reduction in finance costs overall. But when you look at our EBIT and our profit-before-tax apologies you can definitely see that there has been a growth in profit-before-tax very aggressive just over 200% growth and that has been driven primarily by the good performance top line all the way through our EBIT with sustained momentum from an EBITDA perspective, a reduction in our depreciation and a core reduction in our finance and cost year and year. Looking now at how that composition of our revenues made up our revenue has grown consistently so all our revenue categories have grown. You can see from a prepaid perspective we have grown by two percent as George mentioned earlier that growth has been driven by our data led propositions throughout and a continued change and mix that has happened in that portfolio. From a contribution perspective to four revenue the prepaid has reduced by circa three percentage points year and year from 53 percent to 50 percent and that just speaks to our strategic focus areas and accelerated growth we're seeing in those focus areas. Most of that growth has been or contribution has moved into other revenue. Our other revenue has grown by circa 10 percent year and year and you can see from a contribution perspective that that has increased by three points or three percent. Our other revenue segment is made up of a combination of enterprise revenue, digital revenue and also fiber and there are other revs sundry revenues and they like interconnect. If you look at our wholesale as mentioned wholesale has grown by 13 percent as a category in total year and year but the core contribution has increased by one percentage point from circa 12 percent to 13 percent in the current financial year. Wholesale revenues are a combination of Envianos, bulk SMSs, A2P and other sundry services. Enviano growth continues to drive the growth within this category and we're quite proud of that movement. From a post-paid perspective we are seeing resilient growth 2 percent. This has been important for us to make sure that we return this full portfolio to growth and hence the 2 percent we do think has been a good performance overall after some years of having shown consistent declines. If you look at that that is in part due to the work that we've been doing in integrating the business back into cell C and we continue to integrate the CC business into our core business. The contribution for post-paid has reduced year and year from circa 20 percent in the prior to circa 19 percent in the current year as we continue with these optimizations. If you try and understand deeper what has driven the performance in prepaid over the year you'll see that the growth is a combination of data-led propositions that are showing good growth. You can definitely see that from looking at our data traffic growth which is averaging 20 percent for the full portfolio. From a broadband perspective our growth is sitting at approximately 11 percent which is in line with what we expect from that proposition. From an ARP perspective you do see a much as our core base has marginally reduced and our ARP has reduced we continue to see some consistent and stable growth in our active core and you can see that predominantly in our active data subs which are currently sitting at circa 4.3 million which is a 4 percent increase year and year. Looking at the drivers of post-paid and what is driving that base from a traffic perspective you can definitely see that for this portfolio our voice traffic unlike the rest of industry has continued to grow growing by 1 percent and our data traffic has accelerated growth as we've diversified that portfolio. That portfolio is now sitting at a data traffic growth of 23 percent. Our ARPOO has done a marginal shift down to 224 and which is circa 2 percent but that is driven by an intentional drive to reduce our on billers in our contribution to the total portfolio. Looking at our core base and how that is constituted our full base for post paid is sitting at 798,000 as at the end of the financial period but that is made up of two components our core base and our on biller base. The performance that you are seeing in our overall drive and the ARPOO numbers is definitely driven by the deliberate drive to then reduce our on billers hence you continue to see that our ARPOO has marginally reduced in line mostly to our core base reduction. If you then look at our MVNO's we're quite proud of that performance and you definitely see the industry at large all our MVNO's continue to announce very good results. They own their own base so we cannot speak to their base. We can only talk to what we see on our HLR. We continue to see approximately a 28 percent increase on the HLR year and year for all our MVNO's which have continued to show sustainable growth. Our data traffic for this core component is growing at over 100 percent at 127 percent year and year showing the fruitfulness of the data-laid strategy that the different MVNO's are following but also the voice traffic albeit the reduction in traffic usage for voice in the rest of the market. In this segment voice traffic is growing by 2 percent which talks to consistent performance. Looking at our balance sheet I know George had said some colorful words about our balance sheet before but I think from a baseline perspective we have definitely recovered and are showing some good recovery and promised recovery as we've messaged before. Our total assets up 22 percent we are still following our capex light model. The increase in our assets is not driven by core capex only. It is however driven by a deferred tax asset that was recognized in the year. If you could look at our liabilities down 8 percent which is a good movement despite the increase in our long-term liabilities which are our shareholder loans there are other core reductions in normal trading payables and leases in that category that are resulting to a reduction in total liabilities. It is good to note that of our total liabilities approximately 60 percent of that amount is made up of shareholder secured or unsecured debt and that then helps analyze that number. Looking at our equity driven by the good performance that we've seen at a profit level and also the recognition of the deferred tax asset you definitely do see a movement in our equity position which has come in at an improvement of 21 percent. Overall we are quite excited about the performance that we've seen in this financial year and we think we can sustain this and do better as we continue. I'm now hand over back to George so he can take you through the balance of the day. Thank you very much for that L and now looking ahead I think first and foremost we want to maintain the transformation momentum that we've enjoyed so far and really reinforce the operational and financial discipline that's required. Secondly is to conclude the post paid business integration so the CEC full integration to capture the full synergies of both businesses and make sure we're ready to scale. Thirdly leverage the Envio leadership position that we enjoy today and really accelerate wholesale growth strategic lever for us. Fourth we want to make sure that we grow in scale the enterprise business is a key driver of diversification I think we've enjoyed some success so far but really want to scale up on this. Fifth we'd like to sustain a high performance value driven culture to support consistent delivery and and last but not least we want to make sure that we continue building sustainably to unlock future growth and now I'm going to hand over to Dean. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen the highlights for the year ended 31st of May 2025 whereas follows revenue of 14.1 billion an inclusion of the gross amount generated on pinless top-ups prepaid electricity ticketing and universal vouchers the effective increase equated to 7% from 89.3 billion to 96 billion. Gross profit increase by 2% to 1.38 billion. Increase in gross profit margin from 22.57% to 24.02%. EBITDA increase by 31% to 1.6 billion. Core headline earnings for the period was 461.63 cents per share. With reference to group revenue revenue generated on prepaid air time and pinless top-up declined by 381 million from 30.8 billion to 30.5 billion in line with expectations. Electricity revenue generated on behalf of the utilities increased by 8.1 billion 22% from 36.2 billion to 44.2 billion. Net commission earnings primarily calculated based on kilowatt hour consumption increased by 30 million 12% from 263 million to 293 million. The growth in commissions were driven by inflationary increases linked to kilowatt hour usage and higher electricity consumption. However, this was offset by margin compression despite an overall increase in gross electricity revenue supported by nurse approved tariff adjustments. Gross revenue from universal vouchers declined by 601 million 4% to 15.3 billion compared to 15.9 billion in the prior year. The decrease resulted from the termination at the end of the previous year of voucher sales that contributed 5.2 billion in the comparative year but carried negligible margin. Excluding this one self-impact underlying growth amounted to 4.6 billion 42% underpinned by the continued expansion of blue voucher sales through financial institution channels. Despite the decline in gross ticketing revenue of 143 million 9% commission earned increased by 2 million ran 2%. The improvement was driven by growth in commuter bus channel revenues offset by reduction in sales from music festivals and concerts which have historically generated lower margins. Gross profit increased by 80 million 2% from 3.295 billion to 3.375 billion corresponding to an increase in margins from 22.57% to 24.02%. Excluding the positive extraneous contributions of 176 million in the current year attributable to fair value gains on the grammacy and SPV1 derivative instruments partially offset by fair value loss on the clause B preferences, EBITDA increased by 202 million 17% from 1.225 billion to 1.428 billion. This increase reflected a 288 million decline in comm equipment company offset by a 490 million ran increase across the remaining group entities compared to the prior year. The decline in comm equipment company's EBITDA was primarily attributable to a reduction in the subscriber base and a decrease in average revenue per user. Included in the group share of losses from associates of 55 million is the recognition of the group share of Celsius accumulated net losses from 1 June 2019 to the 31st of May 2024 which amounted to 1.607 billion. This was partially offset by the groups recognizing its share of Celsius net profits of 1.508 billion in the current year primarily attributable to the recognition of a portion of Celsius deferred tax asset as well as 43 million in profits from other associates. As of the 31st of May 2025 the group has fully recognized its share of all previous unrecognized historical losses associated with Celsius. Excluding the net positive extraneous contribution of 1.713 billion arising primarily from the reversal of the CELSE impairment, the subsequent recognition of the group share of previous unrecognized losses and related headline earning adjustments, core headline earnings increased by 1.755 billion 258 from 607 to the 9 million to 2.434 billion. This increase reflected a 347 million decline in comm equipment company offset by a 2.10 billion increase across the remaining group entities compared to the prior year. Core headline earnings per share excluding the extraneous contributions increased by 256 percent from 76.08 cents in the prior year to 270.95 cents. Moving on to the balance sheet, total assets increased by 4.6 billion to 19.8 billion comprising a growth of 1.2 billion in non-current assets and 3.4 billion in current assets. The increase in non-current assets included a 1.711 billion increase in investments in associates, a 168 million increase in advances to customers, a 44 million increase in intangible assets, and a 61 million increase in deferred taxation assets. These increases were partially offset by a 664 million decline in loans to associates and joint ventures, a 55 million decrease in property plant and equipment, and a 28 million decline in financial assets measured at fair values through profit and loss. The net growth in current assets included increases of 1.501 billion in loans to associates and joint ventures, 1.064 billion in trade and other receivables, 410 million in financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, 240 million in advances to customers, and 256 million in inventory. The increase in investments in associates of 1.711 billion included the reversal of 1.559 billion relating to the initial payment of 2.5 billion in blue labels investment in CLC, an additional investment of 241 million relating to SPV FIVE's funding obligations to DOG FABA Africa, and the group share of CLC earnings for the current year amounting to 1.508 billion. Offset by the recognition of the group share of CLC's accumulated net losses for the period one June 2019 to the 31st of May 2024 amounting to 1.607 billion. The increase in financial assets at fair value through profit and loss of 382 million related primarily to the group's ROT to acquire derivative instruments measured at fair value. The net increase of 837 million in current and non-current loans to associates and joint ventures primarily related to the CLC debt funding and reinvestment instruments, the CEC deferral loan, and the acquisition of a new loan from Cremercy of 408 million. Total interest accrued on these instruments amounted to 709 million, reversal of expected credit losses totaled 308 million, partially offset by repayments of 538 million. Loans receivable also decreased by 23 million following the reclassification of total loans to third-party loans following the disposal thereof. Net profit attributable to equity holders amounted to 2.5 billion resulting in accumulated capital and reserves of 7.6 billion. Non-current liabilities decreased by 105 million, reflecting a reduction in non-current borrowings of 166 million. It deferred tax liabilities of 133 million, partially offset by an increase of 185 million in financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss relating to the clause B preference shares. Current liabilities increased by 2.2 billion, primarily due to an increase in current borrowings of 1.5 billion and an increase of 640 million in trade and other payables. The total increase of 1.3 billion in current and non-current borrowings mainly reflected higher utilisation of short-term working capital facilities for bulk inventory purchases. Moving on to the cash flow statement, cash generated from trading operations amounted to 488 million. Working capital movements included an increase in inventory of 264 million, trade and other receivables of 1.1 billion and advances to customers of 479 million offset by an increase in accounts payable of 694 million. After incurring net finance costs of 633 million and taxation of 321 million, net cash utilised in operating activities amounted to 466 million. On a normalised basis, cash generated from operating activities would have been positive, excluding adverse working capital movements relating to CELCE, lower trade receivable collections resulting from the year in falling on a Saturday and excess inventory purchases. Net cash flow utilised in investing activities amounted to 301 million, primarily attributable to the purchase of intangible assets amounting to 443 million, property plant and equipment of 48 million and the additional investment in CELCE through SBV5 of 100 million. These outflows were partially offset by the repayments of loans by associates and joint ventures of 245 million. Included in the loan repayments by associates and joint ventures of 245 million are capital repayments by CELCE of 231 million and capital payments by other associates and joint ventures of 14 million. Cash flows generated from financing activities amounted to 692 million, of which 750 million related to a net increase in interest bearing borrowings. These inflows were partially offset by dividend payments of 26 million to minority shareholders of subsidiary companies and lease repayments of 30 million. Cash and cash equivalents accumulated to 821 million at the 31st of May 2025. We'd like to extend our gratitude to the Blue Label Board of Directors, the staff, suppliers, customers and business partners for their ongoing support and dedication to the group. Thank you. The floor is now open to questions. Good morning everybody and welcome to our results presentation for May 2025. We'll open it up first to questions online. Can I go online to see if there's any questions online? There are currently no questions though. Thank you. Okay, so moving on to the questions that were sent through to us, starting with Howard Lowenthal. Howard, how are you? First question, what is the value per blue share of the CELC holding over to you Dean? Thank you. If we look at it from a summarized group income statement perspective, you would see that the core headline earnings excluding the extraneous contribution amounted to 270.95 cents. Of that amount included in the group share of income from associates and joint ventures is the profits made or our group share of the profits made for CELC that amounted to 1.507 billion. So from an income statement perspective, that would equate to 167.84 cents. I think if we look at it from a valuation perspective, you would see in our annual financial statements that we have valued CELC at 4.7 billion rand. I think it's important to emphasize that the valuation did not incorporate the impact of any restructure yet. So our share, we have a 70% economic interest in CELC. So if you take 70% of the 4.7 billion, that would amount to 3.29 billion. We have 913 million shares in issue. So it would equate to approximately 3 and 60 per share. Thank you, Dean. The next question from Howard is good day. What is, sorry, not that one. It's a similar one. From Mort and Lowenthalen, please explain the metrics for the CELC listed. At this stage, Mort, we're going to keep that pretty generic. There are a lot of questions around the CELC listing. I'll touch on a few of them so we don't have to go through each of them individually. But when is it taking place? Obviously, Howard will look what is our plan to do with the listing and how, of course, Blue Label will look afterwards. And of course, CELC will look afterwards. These are all extremely good questions. Nothing wrong with the questions at all. However, for now, we're going to keep it more generic. As we've told the market, we are moving potentially to a separate listing of CELC. We work in very hard towards it, constantly in exact time frame on it, as there's a lot of moving parts. And of course, as we get closer to being able to release things, we will. That will give you a great indication of the timing. And more importantly, of course, when we release the things, it will spell it out clearly exactly what our intention is to do, what the listing will look like, what CELC will look like post the listing, and of course, what Blue Label would look like post the listing. So it is our intention to do it, and we'll update you as we go along. The next question is from Philip Short. I'm trying to see how core Blue Label operations did. Reported EBITDA grew 17%, but if I take out the negative growth of CEC, which is potentially being sold to CELC, EBITDA grew 38%. First of all, is this correct and second of all, what is driving this growth? We'll answer the second part of the question, and Dean, I'll answer the first part. Thanks Phil. So with regards to that comment, it is correct. As you would have seen in the presentation, we said CEC had a negative effect of 288 million on our EBITDA if we separated from the remainder of the businesses within the Blue Label group. So the increase in the EBITDA would have been higher from that perspective both at an EBITDA and a core HEPs level. Just maybe on that point, if I can just try to reiterate, because from a perspective of core HEPs, what we attempted to illustrate in the financials was in the group summarised financials. You would see if we exclude the extraneous contribution, the group made 2.4 billion rand. As we said, the group share of CELC profits was 1507 billion of that amount. So if we take that out of the 2.4 billion, it would have left us as Blue Label excluding CELC with 926 million rand. A weighted average number of shares is 898 million shares, which would equate to approximately 103 cents. So that would summarise the growth of 36% compared to the 679 million that was recorded in last year's results. Thank you, Dean. I think there's lots of questions that are similar. So I'm just going to pass it over to George to give us a nice update on CELC position and Comcom. Thank you, Brett. So I think it's always been the intention, first and foremost, to bring the, let's call it the post-paid business back into CELC. I think that's a natural fit. So that application has been processed and we've got unconditional support from Comcom. So that will be one of the steps, obviously, as one of the legs in the potential listing. I think the way that we are structured is a post-paid business, prepaid business, consumer, enterprise, fixed, as well as wholesale from AMVIA know. So it's complementary to what we already do and leverages the benefits of both businesses. So what CC brings to the table, what CELC brings to the table, and the combined asset then will look substantially better and set us up for the future. So I think it's a natural move and hopefully that process is very much underway and will update the market in the next steps as time unfolds. Thank you, George. Next question is on operating cash flow. I appreciate the many moving parts, but what is the more normalized number over to you, Dean? Thanks. So if we looked at our cash flow, you'd see that the net cash utilized in operating activities amounted to negative 466 million. As we've said before, we need to look at primarily the two largest items that impact this amount was the net effect of the movement in working capital relating to CELC, that amounted to 1.3 billion rand. If we look at that, that relates to prepayments made for additional inventory for CELC. And I think with regards to that amount, this will form part of the data equity conversion on the potential restructure of CELC. So if you add back 1.3 billion to that amount, together with because the financial results fell on a Saturday, our year end being the 31st of May, fell on a Saturday, this resulted in a reduction in cash collections of approximately 184 million rand. So if you include those two together, you would see normal cash generated from operations would be in excess of a billion rand. Thank you, Dean. And next one, Paul, Wintborn, how's it Paul? I read it out the first part, we've answered, but can you provide a timeline for the listing of CELC? When do you expect to get there was a hearing on the 6th of August 2025 on the prepaid company in CELC merger, followed by a few days later by hearing on CEC? The CEC outcome is published, but still no info on the CELC merger. Can you provide some guidance on what is happening? Paul correctly, it went to the tribunal, as you say, in August of 2025. We received one or two small questions after that. We are expecting and hoping that we will get the answer very shortly in the next call at seven to ten days. And of course, as soon as we get it, and of course, we open it for it to be favorable. We don't foresee why it shouldn't be. We will obviously release a sentence on it as soon as we get it, but it's imminent. Okay, the next one is from David Eberall. Congrats on the new branding. With respect to core Eberall, you mentioned a 516 million increase in the remaining group entities. CEC offset some of that. Could you please unpack what the 500 million came from? Is it accounting related or something else? Dean, you're very popular today. So, thanks. So, if we look at the 500 million, we've separated CEC from the results. CEC contributed a negative amount to core headline earnings. This is part of the restructure where, I think, to Philip's question, the restructure will result in CEC potentially being sold to CELC. So, as Philip mentioned, that negative movement in CEC would result in the overall profit that I mentioned of the 926 million would have been after the losses from CEC from that perspective. Thank you, Deanie. Next one, Paul again. CELC Eberall of 2.1 billion exceeds Eberall of 1.6 some gardens on the expected depreciation charge for 2026. Over to you, L. Thanks, Britt. And thanks for the question. So, from a depreciation perspective, we're averaging around 500, 550 million. And that's what you're seeing as the core move from Eberall into Eberall. We do expect that that depreciation will remain fairly flat over the next couple of years because we've done our biggest investments to date. So, it should normalize in and around that 550 mark. Thank you, L. Next question is from Junior Smith. Good afternoon. Will there be a resumption in dividends and when? Junior, absolutely. It is our intention as both Blue Label and CELC to pay dividends and to resume it. We obviously have a nouns core production. We have obviously announced a certain restructuring that we are about to go under. All things being equal. We really believe as soon as this listing or this potential listing of CELC, and let's call it the demerger of CELC and Blue Label takes place, we really hope in that dividends will then resume on both ends of it. But of course, that happens at the time. There's things to it. There's obviously boards, but it is the intention. And of course, we'll update as we go along. The next one is, thank you. That's a nice one. The next one is from Hanshenck. Hi, everyone. Congrats on a solid set of results. Apologies for the small basic question, but just on the energy solution side and specifically the way in which you identify a lost or stolen prepaid tokens. Without obviously divulging too much, how does it work in broad terms? Is there law enforcement present or is municipal officials? Thank you in regards. Yeah, thanks for the question. It's a pretty simple way of analysing. A lot of the fraud or a lot of the miscalculations happen more in the large power users. So 65% of the expenditure or spend in electricity comes from large power users, which are a much smaller base in any municipality ranging from a couple of hundred to probably 15,000 being the largest. So that's who we intend auditing. If there are fraud on tokens, it happens within the environment, not in the Blue Label environment, where people are forging those tokens and then redeeming against the system. I think the bigger problem, the bigger issue that we have is the incorrect or fraudulent transactions that happen within the large power users, whereby what we intend doing is, as I explained, on a no-risk model. So unless we go and collect more than they have been collecting on an average base, then there's no need to pass. We think roughly about 30% of all electricity that is bought is lost or stolen in this process. So it's probably a 20 to 40 billion round size of the price in the industry that is being lost. If you consider, if we pick a number of 20, you're talking about source potentially losing about three and a half billion round of vegetable revenue. If you find that money, it goes straight into municipality, straight back into responding and blocking or stopping these leakages. And I think also paramount to this is our ability to train and deploy people in those environments where we're doing these audits and stuff. So a lot of opportunity in that space bear in mind these 200 odd municipalities out there all facing very similar classes. Thank you, Mark. Two questions for CELSI. First one, could you please give us a sense of what CapEx will be next year and any news on the franchise in of your stores? Over to you, Jordan L. Yeah, thank you. So currently we have 105 stores. We've rebranded 50 already. We have 40 company-owned stores and that process is underway. It's at the very beginning phases. We're franchising those 40 so staff will then be catered for, as per the label or for 12-month period once it's franchised and then thereafter they come off our books from a payroll point of view. And the reason just to reiterate again is we believe the success of a franchise environment is much better than corporate-owned stores. And we've seen that in the results so far and particularly the ones that we've revamped, they also are up in terms of performance. So that's very much the direction of travel for better success. So that's where we are with the franchising of the stores. And then on CapEx, we've always said that we've coming from an environment where we've had to fix quite a bit of the past and to else question that was answered just a short while ago around the depreciation with the big CapEx projects that we've done, i.e. prepaid billing systems, etc. We have one more to do which is our post-paid billing system and that's one of significant size. But we'll land up at a between a $6.50, $8.50 million kind of number on CapEx depending on the kind of projects that we have. And that largely will go to customer facing activities. So the franchising of the stores when we do the rebuilds, etc. We've just launched a new CELSI app. So that's got digital focus. We've redone our USSD channel. We've also implemented a personalization platform called My Connector Platform. So we're investing into customer facing tech and that's what's yielding the results. So somewhere in that range is what we're looking at in the future. Thank you, George. The next question to you. Envio-no business outperforms the market. Are you not worried about the quality of the network as you continue to add more Envio-no's? How much power do Envio-no's have, the power to price the whole CELSI contracts you have with them on a yearly basis? Thank you, Brett. It's a great question. I think just to create a bit of colour as well around that is the capacity that we buy from largely the two bigger network operators. It's a good partnership. It's a good agreement. The long-term agreement is of high margin to them. It's a good quality deal. And so it's largely excess capacity that is purchased. So that's why the high quality margin to the two network operators in particular. And the route that we've chosen is to go and address this market segment through these brands and partnerships in the Envio-no space. You'll see a lot in food retail as well as banking. So we believe that the partnerships that we have are very good ones. And we've priced our business to make sure that they are very competitive in the market. We believe the margins are acceptable. We've approached it in a real partnership model. So dovetailing, where there's an opportunity to address that market segment either through the bank or the retailer, which perhaps we wouldn't be able to address with our own direct brand in the form of CELSI. So we do believe that there's got some runway. It's a very small percentage. It's about five percent of our traffic at the moment. So it's got significant upside. It's growing this proportionate to the market because it's been deliberate and intentional from our side to make sure that that sector is very well priced and is set up for sustainable growth. So we've made sure that we didn't hang onto very high margins and get a huge amount of profitability. And then you have challenges. We want to make sure that it's really sustainable for a number of years to come. So we're quite confident that this will remain. If you look at the other part of the question around network quality, we have the best 4G video experience in the country. And overall, we're number two in terms of all the metrics that you measure a network quality by. So it's a fundamentally different CELSI from a network technology perspective that you've seen from yours ago. And we've actually called that as a call to and switch to C is the slogans that we've gone out with for people to actually have a look and see what our network is really about. So we're quite confident about the network quality as well. Thank you, George. Another question to you. To Elle. The assets on the CELSI balance sheet seem very low at $5 billion. How is spectrum valued on the CELSI balance sheet? Is this a fair reflection of its market value? Thank you. That's a great question. And thanks, Brett. Because we are capex light, we do not hold big capex balances on our books. And even the assets that we do hold, because they are customer facing and more system, it's more intangibles that we have on our books at the moment. From a spectrum perspective, our spectrum is held at cost. So we do not revalue the spectrum on our books at the moment. And most of our spectrum assets are already fully depreciated. So do I think you could get a bigger asset value if you revalued our spectrum assets? Definitely. But are the spectrum, are the assets as we reflect them on our balance sheet in line with if risk and policies and procedures, yes, that they are. But from that perspective, it's always good to remember. We do not have towers, so we do not have a big asset base. What we have in there is literally the operational assets only. And as of this year, we then have the deferred tax asset as well. Thank you. Next question to Mark. I see on the presentation is mention of Technovate. Can we share more on that? Thanks. Yeah. One would be remiss in today's time, not to focus on data, the internet of things, IT and augmented reality. Technovate is designed really around taking data, taking technology and trying to implement it in everyday environments where problems exist that technology can solve. We have partnered with CELC in this on the RT15, which allows us then to go deploy technologies in healthcare, in those environments can occur in real time. So from an IT perspective, I know it's a little word with lots of meanings. We have found some applications to directly deploy into the market. And then with our data CELC on the connectivity and know-how and our implementation, there's lots of opportunities within the market. Thank you, Mark. Okay. Over to Rory. How's it Rory? How are you? Okay. I'm going to try and break this question up a bit. But putting aside the potential RPO of CELC, what is the anticipated flow of cash between CELC and Blue label for the 2026 financial year and beyond? Please break it up between servicing debt, capital repayments on the debt, if any airtime net between Blue and CELC and other flows of cash. Okay. I'll answer this one. So if there is no RPO of CELC, the cash is already flowing. So CELC have been up to date since October of last year with all interest payments. So interest is flowing on the debt inside CELC. There is an open above that mechanism to de-stock a small amount of Blue label stock on a monthly basis. That's also been taking place. So on the first two parts, there is no new cash flowing into CELC. Meaning CELC does not require any more cash since October. We actually announced that in February, and that has remained. So we're really happy about that. And I think it's a major step for CELC. And with that, obviously, the flow of CELC's interest to us has been, which has continued. As I said, a small de-stock in position of around 15 to 20 million round a month. That has continued. So everything on that basis is good. The bullet payment that you're referring to is in March of 2026, which is a 1 billion round of our 3 billion round bullet and obviously, we on schedule for that, we will deal with it as soon as we see what we happen in either with the listing or not at least listing. But those are the flow of cash that has to flow from CELC to Blue label. And as I said, no cash flowing from Blue label to CELC, which is good. You want to add anything to that? El Lord, okay. Good. Well, you can give them more cash if you want. Okay. Then moving on to the next question. CELC. CELC, the 2.1 billion round EBITOR for 2025, implying that 1.3 billion in the second half. If we assume no growth on H2 2025 fully or EBITOR, would we be correct and expect an approximately 2.6 billion round for 2026? So expectations for the coming year. There are elements that have changed in the market in general. One of them being the likes of termination rates. So termination rates have stepped down. So you do have to make those adjustments into the book. And there were some items that have been reprised. So from extrapolating it into the future, I wouldn't do a straight line extrapolation. I would always stick within the ambit of a 10% to 15% increase on a normalized basis. From an EBITOR growth perspective, this is excluding anything that would happen post IPO if that does happen. So from a guidance perspective, I would follow that guidance. But from a straight line, please do not straight line the performance. There are elements that have to change. As George mentioned, from an Envio knows perspective, we are competitively priced. We have looked at different elements and have reprised even to our end customers. So our revenue is definitely stepping down a little bit. But our costs will not step down at the same rate. Thank you all. Okay, last question here for now is why was CEC lost market this year? So just to repeat what we said in February, I would not repeat, but rather refresh. So the first, it's broken into three parts. The first part is that we used a large portion of CEC's book or balance sheet to fund the lost element of CEC, which was required prior to this year, which was the last 1.2 billion rand, of which we used approximately 900 million rand. That obviously has a net effect of them going downwards. So we obviously saw it as a group. That's really a one sort and we understood what we're doing. It was either doing it via Blue Label itself or via CEC. The more important part is the second and third. We've obviously been looking at this deal with CEC. CEC did a lot of things good from the back end, if I can put it that way. CEC can do a far better job. Well, as I should as a network on the post-paid on the front end, on the actual stores, on the actual tariff in, on the actual ranging and so on. So there's been a transition period obviously waiting for Com Com to come through so that we could actually move it. Now that Com Com is through, we're just waiting to finalize a few things. So we have no doubt that we've seen the worst if I can put that off CEC. If you add just back in what the cost of what we actually cost them, if I could say it as a group, it actually wasn't as bad. It actually was a lot better than what you've seen, but it's a cost for the group. So when it goes back into CEC, it's much more of a fresh look. It's obviously clean. It doesn't have the cost that Blue Label bore for it. So we have no doubt that back in CEC it will do well straight away and it will be back to probably where it was and if not bed in CEC's hand. So we are aware of it. We are on top of it, but I do think we at the end of the cycle of it. And then another question has come through. Do CEC plan to keep CEC on the balance sheet or will it sell the book to the banks in order to keep cell C assets locked? Thank you. It's a good question. There's a preference to have an off balance sheet structure going forward, but those are options that have not been exercised yet. So today it is where it is, that facility when we assume the CEC business is full assets and liability, which will come with a loan that today is with the African bank. So that will remain. And then we'll look at the options going forward. So there's many ways to do it. We're exploring all options that we wanted to see what's the most efficient way to do it. I think from a skill set point of view, we have that capability and talent. We've run post-bed businesses before. So I don't want to say it's second nature, but it will come quite naturally in the way that we operate that business. So these are choices that are being explored at the moment and we'll select the best option going forward. Thank you, George. Just moving back to the line. Is there any questions on the line? Dr. Karan, moment there are no questions. Thank you very much. Okay, then to just wrap it up from our side. I think as a whole, and we understand that the numbers are, of course, confusing again. I think we did lead towards that in February that and try to explain that they would be what they are. We're obviously going to go on a roadshow where we will give everyone the time they're required to unpack it. Obviously, if there's anything directly that you'd like to deal with the accountants of Celsius and blue label, we always have an open door for that. So please use it and we're happy to unpack it. I think when you do, you're going to see that blue label and Celsius have really had a good year. May 25 was a, I'm actually using the word great year. It was a great year for Celsius. It was a great year for blue label. And I think more importantly, we already passed May 25, we three months into the new year, and things are really looking good on both ends on the Celsius and then the blue label. So we actually look forward to unpacking it for you to take you through the new branding or blue label to show you the new strategy, the simplification of what we're doing. And then where we're in agreement with all of you is we look forward to where we can separate these two companies. So we give everyone the opportunity to value Celsius for what it is, to value blue label for what it is, and of course give value to the shareholders which we believe we will. So thank you all for your support and to Celsius and your team. Thank you for a really sterling great year and to blue label and our management well done and to both respect the boards of Celsius and blue label. Thank you and I hope to see you all soon. Cheers.
