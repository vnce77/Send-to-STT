Good day, everybody. My name is Ash Forma. I cover Smith Care Biotech and Spec Forma, and welcome to UBS Healthcare Conference, our next company here, Bridge Biocross. I'm Ash Forma, and I just quickly interviewed our panelists, so Anand Sridhar, Anna Waite, and then Chima Shukla. So thank you, everybody, for joining us. A lot of different things going on with your story. So maybe I'll just, like, give an open-ended question, and then we can sort of go in from there. And just for the audience who are in the room, if you want to submit a question through the QR code, like that will pop up here at this iPad, hopefully, and I can bring that in towards the end of the discussion. But with that, yeah, maybe just if you can get it started on, like, the recent CQ update, and you've had a few different, like, pipeline readouts come out in the last few weeks, essentially. Yeah, happy to talk about that. So first of all, Ash, thank you for hosting us, and thank you to the entire UBS team for giving us an opportunity to participate in the conference, and thank you to the investors who have shown a lot of interest in our story. So, CQ, you know, is really a transformational period for the company. I think, you know, we've shown this here that we can really distribute our product commercially, you know, very competitive market, and we continue to show that in the third quarter earnings calls. Our volume accelerated, our price is stable, so our sales have really started to accelerate. So we feel great about that engine, and then we further buttress that engine by reading out two phase three trials, both in very large, you know, billion-dollar-plus opportunities, ADH1 and Caledet and ADH1 with an expansion opportunity in chronic HP, and then BBV418 in LGMD2I with an expansion opportunity in LGMD2M2U and also Fukuyama disease. So we feel we feel we're very well positioned to transition into becoming a diversified rare disease company, and on top of all of that, we also have an exciting phase three update coming up in early 26 for Infogratnib and e-contraplasia, and then later in 26 we'll read out a proof-of-concept study for Infogratnib and hypercontraplasia. So a lot happening. I'm happy to dive into all of that, but I think the takeaway is that the company is now transforming itself into being a diversified genetic disease company with multiple big products. Great. Good start. So maybe just if we talk about the, or should we, like, the launch has been really successful so far, and the update that you provided in terms of the patient acts in 3Q, and seems to be pretty broad-based as well. What I'm trying to understand is where, like, what are the sources of the revenue, like, with which type of patients are starting to get on the treatment? Yeah, it's a great question. So like you said, you know, the update has been really broad both in terms of patients but also in terms of physicians who are prescribing, regions in the US which are prescribing. So that gives us a lot of confidence that this is quite robust and it's going to continue in the future. Having said that, we've always focused most on the treatment 90s section of the market or the first line section of the market. We continue to see every single month more treatment 90s patients started to be in the previous month. You know, every time we've reported our quarterly number, we've said that our treatment 90s patients have been a majority of them, and I think in the last update we said that our share is well in the 20s now there and, you know, they comprise of a vast majority of our patients now. So we feel very good about how a 2B is being used by all patients and all physicians, and we're particularly thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the treatment 90s section of the market. Yeah, I hear this from some of the other competitors as well, just like treatment naive, you know, adoption has been very strong. I mean, excuse me, what is essentially driving behind us is like a lot of disease awareness and just the availability of the therapy or is there any, what are some of the pushes that you're doing from a commercial standpoint to get more patients activated? Yeah, yeah, it's a good question. So the market has definitely expanded. If you look here over here, the market has expanded meaningfully. We used to say that there are about 2 to 3,000 treatment 90s patients who would start therapy every quarter last year. Today we are saying it's at least 3,000 patients, but there are probably more than 3,000 patients. So, you know, number one, the size of the pie has expanded for everyone. That's mainly because of more players coming on the market and more awareness of the disease. That's also activated different types of physicians who are finding these patients, which has really benefited at 2B, especially in the high volume heart failure clinics section of the market. Beyond that, I think that for a 2B specifically, you know, we've had very strong clinical data and really our commercial strategy has been to lead with our clinical data. So whether that's in the AFER population, which is about half of these patients where we have shown the best point estimate, whether it's in the variant subpopulation, where again we have shown a profound benefit, including a static benefit on mortality and hospitalization, where we continue to publish, including at AHA, you know, more data. I think that those kinds of, you know, real world evidence generation showcasing a 2B's unique profile, coupled with the market growing, has helped us to really accelerate this launch, I would say. I just, as you look towards like 2026, do you think that the focus will continue to be on the naive patients or is that started diversified a little bit? Yeah. So, you know, we've had a very broad and balanced sort of uptake across all sort of sections of the market, but, you know, treatment I have seen in the focus, it will continue to be the focus. I expect that, you know, our switch share has now stabilized. So I think that I don't, you know, I expect that in 26 and beyond, we're going to continue to see a lot of growth from the treatment naive section, and I think we continue to get our fair share of switches. All right. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that, like I've started to hear from investors, just on the impact of Windequail. So, I mean, you might have seen, like, they missed their Windequail number a couple of weeks ago when they announced the earnings, which has again kind of stirred this controversy. Is the market finite? And is it, you know, like, a zero swing game between between the three players? So, just curious, like, what, like, when you see that happening, like, what does that tell you? Is that a good or a bad sign? Yeah. I think that maybe there are two aspects of this. Maybe I'll break it down into the volume and the price. I think if you look at the commentary from Pfizer, they very clearly talked about double-digit demand growth, right? And I think that, again, if you look here over here, given that the families has to have an IRA impact this year, right? So, that means that their volume has to go up by 25% here over here just to match the sales number, given the 20% rebate to Medicare. You know, I think that that continues to say that, you know, given their annualizing at about $4 billion in the U.S., continues to say that the market is very large. And it continues to grow. I think that stabilizers remain the backbone of care. Having said that, yes, it is true that we have taken, you know, again, the company commented on their own earnings call that a truebie has taken share. And, you know, we continue to position ourselves as the best stabilizer, the best first-line option for these patients. So, I do think that this is a market where, you know, all players are going to do extremely well. But I also think that a truebie is going to be, you know, we have certainly said that our goal is to be 30 to 40% of the overall market. And internally, given, you know, the strong start that bear or partner has had in Europe where they are at a majority share, internally, we do try to push ourselves to see that, hey, can we go beyond the 30 to 40 and get a majority share in this market, right? And then I guess just the piece about the Pfizer, you know, competitive dynamic. So, they have been saying that there would be more spicy pressure on them going forward. Can that translate to a more sort of a broader impact on the overall market or is it something that is single-out just to when to go? Yeah. So, so far, we haven't seen any pricing pressures for us. I think that a truebie is in a very, very privileged position, right? So, one, we were quite responsible in how we priced and Neil, our CEO, has commented on this and all of our earnings calls. Like, we do expect long-term, you know, prices in the category have to come down, which is why we started out at 10% discount to the families despite having, you know, what I would say really strong data on hospitalization, you know, fastest time to separation on hard outcomes, both, you know, strong data points that players care about. So, I think given that, coupled with the fact that our strategy remains parity access, we're not looking to pay for preferred access. I think if you rewind a few minutes ago, I was saying that the main driver for us has been our clinical data. We want to do that. We think that if we are all in the physician's office and the physician's making the choice based on data that we will win a lot of patients. And so, I do think that, you know, we don't expect to see any sort of pressure here. We expect our growth to not have to be stable over the next few quarters. So, that's kind of what I would say on that topic. Okay. All right. And then just staying on the same theme. So, as the family goes genetic, yeah, I'm trying to understand, like, what is your base case assumption? Are you seeing any kind of a combo use right now? And can that, like, trigger more of a combo use after, yeah. So, let me first take the combo use question. So, yes, there is combo use in this market. I think it's pretty well known that, you know, folks are using two agents in combination right now. Very little combo use with a true B though. Now, what is interesting to note is that there were guidelines which were published by the ACC a week or two ago, which clearly said that there is no discernible benefit of combination therapy. When you coupled that with the fact that a combination therapy is about 700 and $50,000 a year and you take your previous question about players, right, I do think that that segment of the market is at pretty big risk of just going away. Thankfully, we don't play in that segment, so we worry about it less. As it pertains to your question on TAF IP, I think that our position on this is very clear, right. We've said that we think that the families is protected well into the 2030s, potentially up to 2035 given their polymorph patent. I think that when we look at the fact that physicians and patients and patients are already reaching for a true B4 strike, well into the 20% range treatment naive share means that there's a very big section of the market which prefers to use a true B, which I think further insulates us from whenever TAFCO is genetic. You coupled that with the product hub strategy that they're going on for all signs pointed to the fact that this is going to be a very durable market. And then lastly, you can look at any kind of commercial analog that whether you look at the statin place or whether you look at the pH marketplace, when the first two market molecule, less potent molecule goes generic, the second two market, more potent, differentiated molecule, right, you have a differentiated label, the sales of that product don't really go down. The growth just maybe slows down a little bit, but the sales definitely don't go down in any way. Is that because of the volume dynamic or like pricing pressure or release step at a type of type of volume? So normally what we've seen is that volume continues to grow in those categories because ultimately physicians want to prescribe the most potent molecule and the drugs are not different than cost for the patients. So they don't really, they also want to be on the most potent molecule. So your volume continues to increase and I think when it comes to payers, given you have a large installed base of patients, I think at that time if we give a small rebate, they're not going to require a step at it or something like that. And that's only what we've seen in other categories too. So if your volume continues to accelerate and maybe your price takes a small one-time adjustment, you're going to be able to continue growing through it. And so that's kind of what gives us a lot of confidence here. All right. And then you had some data that you presented at AHA this past weekend. Maybe if you can just kind of highlight what are the key takeaways from that. Yeah, happy to do that. So we had a lot of data which came out at AHA and we had, I would say a very robust engagement with HCPs. Our commercial team was there, they were able to meet with a lot of customers, educate folks on a true beat and really get the word out. And I do think that awareness increasing has driven more diagnosis in the space. So that's one macro comment. The specific data that I would highlight is actually our variant data. So, you know, the variant population here is one which has significant unmet need, right? They have a higher risk of mortality. Currently, it's a severely under-diagnosed piece of the market, right? So it's a place where the market is going to grow in. If you see what we presented there, you know, we've said that we have, where the only agent which is shown a statistically significant difference in mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. And I think that at AHA, we continue to expand on that story with a 59% reduction in ACM and a 69% reduction in ACM and for CV event at 30 months, both of which were stat said. And I think that what was really profound to me as a scientist is, you know, sometimes you'll see these poster presentations and then you don't see a peer-reviewed publication. Maybe it's because I went to grad school and suffered through a lot of peer review. And I think a smile-down view did too. I think that what was very exciting to me is we had a simultaneous publication also. And so the data is now out in a peer-reviewed publish manuscript. So very excited about that. I would say. Great. Awesome. So maybe just like switching gears a little bit, like talk about the pipeline. So you had this a few updates like you said, ADH1 and Limogoda, maybe like I'll start with ADH1. So this phase three update, like can you comment on just the kind of the durability and long-term safety of the normalization effects that happened? Sure. I'll pass it on to a month. Yeah. I'll talk more about ADH1. Yeah, that's a great question. So just to remind folks, we presented top-line results from our study of incalorate in patients of autosomal dominant hypokalemia type 1, ADH1. There's a cohort of about 67 individuals who randomized 2 to 1 to incalorate versus conventional therapy. What we showed in our primary analysis was 76% of people receiving incalorate, normalized their blood and urine calcium by week 24, which is about six months of therapy, compared to 4% of those same individuals on conventional therapy. So it was a dramatically profound result on the primary endpoint of the co-endpoints of normalization of blood and urine calcium. And then to your question of the durability we've seen from our phase 2 cohort evaluating the same criteria that once maintenance doses of incalorate are achieved within about roughly the first month of treatment initiation, the effect seems durable and sustained. And so we've observed that cohort up to three and a half years now. We published those data this summer, presenting durable effect and importantly without the need for dose escalation, which we've seen with other products in this field. So like with this phase 3, would you have more longer-than-follow-up data that we'll start to- We will continue to. And what's heartening about our cohort? So more patients discontinue the standard of care arm, the control arm versus none on the incalorate arm. So it was quite well tolerated and the rollover to the long-term extension was nearly complete. So all those who completed the study, 98% of the completers rolled into the long-term extension. So we will have a rich data set to evaluate for long-term data both on durability, safety, as well as some of the long-term effects on kidney and bone health. Yeah. And then just on this phase 3, so the hypercalemia, so it seems like no discontinuation but some level of hydration that happened, like does that make you believe that could that be limiting in any way in terms of the efficacy for the molecule or like what's sort of happening to try to identify like the right dose at the right time. I think you got it right on which is that early in the titration, there may be excursions in blood calcium, whether it's low or high depending on the individualized dose needs for that patient. We saw one SAE that was related to conventional therapy due to hypercalemia, one on incalor. These are both commonplace for these patients as they try to identify the right dose. And so I think these are familiar circumstances, both are asymptomatic and resolved with dose reduction. So they're transient and they're responsive to dose. They don't require discontinuation. And I think it has no, it's a sign of treatment effect rather than lack of effect. Yeah. I mean with this one, there seems to be a fair bit of debate on just like the market size of the opportunity, right? And like a effectively new ICD 10 code. So yeah, what's your most like most convincing argument for that this is like a big market size? And like do you think that there would be more substantiation of it as you go along in terms of identifying like what, how many patients are out there that actually need this treatment? Absolutely. I do think, well, so to just answer your question directly, we think there's about 12,000 carriers of ADHD1 in the US. So one in 25,000 roughly. And of those 12,000, we think the diagnosis rate somewhere in the 20s, 20% today. There's a coalescence of data that we can look at to get there, which is a mix of ICD 10 coding data. A mix of individuals involved in our clinical program as well as our disease monitoring study, as well as with our genetic testing program, which has yielded a meaningful amount of positive tests for ADHD1. The other element that I would point folks to just from published literature, we presented on our sponsored testing program. ADHD1 is the most common isolated genetic cause of hyperparathyroidism. So if we think about the broad picture of hyperparathyroidism and the overall prevalence, which I believe is not as hotly debated, and we see that ADHD1 is the most common genetic cause. It's kind of hard to decouple the fact that ADHD1 may actually have a prevalence similar to what we've seen in the large genetic population data sets. So I think more to come and as well as increased diagnosis rates with awareness of not only our program, but also this condition and access to genetic testing. Yeah, maybe I'll just add to what an onset, right? I think between the ICD 10 code, the sponsored genetic testing programs, as well as the various folks enrolled in our family members, we've identified 3,500 patients in the US like these are patients which we know who they are, we know the physicians. So I do think that that's going to be the initial target population for us. And if we just get uptake in those 3,500 patients at a genetic disease price point, right? Which can be a meaningful market opportunity of over a billion dollars just in the US. Beyond that, there's the European opportunity. Beyond that, there's an opportunity to drive diagnosis and further increase sales in ADHD1. But that kind of forgives us a lot of confidence here. It's just those 3,500 identified patients by the company. Yeah, and this is something that you're kind of working through, like just on this patient identification path. Yeah, and I... Yes, I also think what's interesting to me is, it's only been a couple of weeks since we announced our data and we've already had families as well as physicians come and bond to us, saying that they have this disease that they would really like to be on the drug. And so, you know, that's also been something which has helped us to continue expanding the number of 3,500 identified patients in the US. Yes, yeah, I think our familiarity with the marketplace and in the last week, it was Kidney Week at the American Society of Nephrology. There were cases for that on ADHD1 as well as providers who mentioned that while we know a lot of the patients today are cared for and diagnosed in endocrinology clinics, they may present in stone clinics as well under nephrologist care. We've learned of a cohort of patients, a stone clinic who have positive variants on their calcium sensing receptor gene. And so, I think there's certainly room to not only grow our familiarity with where these patients are, but grow the diagnosis rate amongst those who have signed the symptoms as well. All right, okay. So, I think this is, you know, kind of a unique dynamic that you have that you're also pursuing for a hyperpara indication with the same molecule. And I know like the pricing strategy can be a little bit custom for this type of dimension in which like on the hyperpara side, there is more like established therapy and sort of crowd market. What's this being, you know, like a more targeted indication? So, what does that, yeah, what's the solution to that effectively here? I think we will start, you know, when we launch an ADH1, we will price it like an ADH1 drug. And I think that as we generate data in chronic HP, which we are very excited about, you know, once we have that data and once we are serving the chronic HP population, we can talk about, you know, thinking about the price a little differently. But at launch, you should expect to see an ADH1 price. Okay. All right. I think the needle throughout this like 300 to 500K range on the 3Q call, I don't know if that's sort of in the same zip code of where you think about this or. Yeah. I think what Neil was trying to say is if you look at sort of genetic diseases, you know, on the low end, I would look at things like Sysvita, right? I mean, your path is approved in HP, which is a much bigger indication and that's priced at about 300K. But really, the more comparable disease, I would say, are excellent type of exelage, which is Sysvita, which is about 400K walk so-go. It's also bigger market than this. That's also around 400K. On the high side, you would look at drugs like Exondas or VICAT, which can be 750K to a million bucks. So that's a pretty broad range. But like, yeah, that's kind of how we get to that sort of three to five K range, which 300 to 500K range, which Neil was talking about on the call, right? How much does the durability of treatment also factor into that dimension, right? Like, do you have a sense on like, is this going to be chronic? We do think this is going to be chronic, but I'm not going to talk about some of the long-term data that you guys already have. Yeah, I mean, so it opens the question about the just that therapeutic hypothesis here. And what we're trying to do with incalarate is we're trying to restore the wild type or the native properties of the receptor. And that is what we're showing with the normalization rate. So we're trying to normalize calcium homeostasis, calcium metabolism in these patients. And so that's why we do expect it to be a chronic therapy. And if it's continuing to yield the benefits like we're seeing in our phase two cohort, two, three and a half years longer, we certainly expect that patients will continue to persist on that therapy. Great. Awesome. So back to you, Anna. Thanks for waiting with me. So just one limb go to say, yeah, like, yeah, here you've had another positive phase three. Maybe if you can talk about like the primary, secondary outcomes and what are the key data points that you showed? Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, Burch, we had a very exciting week. So we read out two positive phase threes. We read out two days before and up trial. So this just takes a step back. We're developing to be people when a full limb good or muscular dystrophy type 2i. And this trial was an interim analysis, which was originally planning to look at a particular biomarker that is close to the disease, looking at changes in glycosylated alpha-district lycan. But we actually feel really profound effects on clinical outcomes. So this is like the first time, I think, really in the muscular dystrophy space that in a randomized controlled trial, we're seeing not only significant stat-sig differences from placebo, but we're also seeing improvements relative to baseline. And so just to go to that in a bit more detail, what we saw was this statistically significant increase in glycosylated alpha-district lycan at both three months and at 12 months. It was way in excess of what we are expecting to target. So we were hoping to see around a 5% increase in this particular protein to see clinical benefit. We saw a 17% increase at three months and then it continued to increase at 12 months. So it ended up being around 24% increase in that protein. Then we saw an 80% decrease in serum-crease in kinase, which is demonstrating an impact to the site of the muscle, so you get less muscle breakdown. And then the thing that was super exciting is we saw improvements on embulation and then also a measure of pulmonary function, so far spied to capacity. So the differences we were seeing there were on the ambulation, it was an increase in velocity of 0.14 milliseconds, a difference from placebo of 0.27 milliseconds. That kind of doesn't sound very much, but over 100 meters, that means the patients are walking 14 seconds faster on treatment than on placebo. And then on the FCC, this is like an endpoint that's been used to approve other drugs, it's very well known. What we saw there was a 2% decline in the placebo group, which is consistent with natural histories, and then we saw a 3% increase in function on drugs. So this was like an incredibly strong data set. And this is considering this data set, we're now going to go to the FDA and before the end of the year to discuss whether this data set could support a traditional fall approval, as opposed to the original strategy, which was an accelerated approval. Yeah. Maybe one thing I'll just add is, as a scientist, it is pretty profound to see that we now have two molecules. Normally when you make a drug, you're trying to slow the progression of a disease. Once in a while, you get a drug like a true bee, which is amazing at just halting the progression of the disease. But now we have two molecules in and calculate and BBP-418, which are reversing the disease, which are approaching towards the cure for the disease. And that's actually very exciting to us from just scientific perspective. Yeah. And then just to let go to the kind of similar vein of questions, what's the most hard concrete evidence that the FDA in terms of patient numbers? Yeah, great. And you'll also hit it a lot of the sort of tailwinds are similar in this space than in the ADH-1 space. But essentially, we estimate around 2,500 patients in the US. That's based off of a prevalent estimate based on, we know the carrier frequency of the disease-closing alleles. We also know that there is like an existing patient pool based on registry data. And then we also had the clinical trial enrolled incredibly fast. So we enrolled 20% over what we were targeting initially in eight months early. So definitely a lot of them that need and patient interest. These patients are typically cared for at sort of MDA clinics. So that's a known entity as well, about 150 MDA clinics in the and a lot of these patients are currently cared for in those clinics. We do know that there's probably some patients that know they have some kind of muscular dystrophy that are not currently genetically diagnosed. And we anticipate that with this being the first disease modifying therapy, hopefully to come to mind that there would be an increase in diagnosis similar to what we saw in the SNA space just prior to launch. And down top of that, what's kind of nice in this space is that there's already sponsored genetic testing. So it's pretty typical that a muscular dystrophy patient, once they go into a clinic, they'll be put on to a sort of expansive muscular dystrophy panel, which includes these genes. And so then they get a diagnosis of LGM-D2I. And then I guess to speak to something that Chinmay said earlier, there are other expansion indications here. So all the data so far is in LGM-D2I. But there's also an opportunity to see you and then see Chiama, a congenital muscular dystrophy. Okay, that's great. Thank you so much for that. I have a couple of quick questions from the audience here. So maybe just, I believe this is for ATTR. So just like the under-diagnosis of the disease and improving diagnosis has been one of the key road drivers. Where do you think we are in terms of penetration of the diagnosis? That's a great question. I think that we are very much still in the early innings. So maybe taking a big step back, I think that the prevalence of ATTR CM in the US is probably around 250k at least. I think that there have been probably 50 to 60,000 patients diagnosed with the disease so far. That means that we are barely a fifth of the way there. So we are very much in the early innings. And one of the things which we track is number of PYP scans. And you can see that that continues to increase every year. And then you obviously see the treatment of these patients. And that you can just look at the claims data. That also seems to be increasing every year. So lots of signs which point to the market growing and accelerating. And I think we are very much in the early innings. We are probably around 20 to 25 percent diagnosed right now. Great. And then one last question here. How do you think the leaders fit into the therapy if they come to the market? Does having a disease modifying therapy put more pricing pressure on the current stabilizer and silencers? Yeah. So we are excited about the pleaters. I think we are going to see what data they show. The depleters are not really in competition, at least with the stabilizers. Because if you think about this disease, this is a mass action disease which is caused by the deposition of toxic monomers into your heart. And what the depleters are doing is they're, you know, as the name says, depleting it from the heart. And I think we guys are acting upstream where we are preventing the deposition. So we actually think that they are very complimentary. We have an early stage program in, you know, developing an ETTR CM depleter. So we are excited about the opportunity. We don't think it's going to cause like pricing pressure or anything like that. But we do think it's going to allow us an opportunity to further serve this patient population and to further reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the condition. Great. With that, we can wrap it up. Thank you so much for this. Thank you, Ash. Thank you. So all of you for joining us. Thank you all.
