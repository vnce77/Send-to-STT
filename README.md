Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Bannegar Indonesia, first of 2025 earnings call. Thank you for joining today. We are pleased to have you with us to review our performance as of the first half of 2025 to share key developments and to also address your questions. I'd like to start by warmly welcoming our directors who are joining us this morning. First, Ibu Alexandra Askandar, Vice President Director, Baba Abu Santosa Soudrajat, Treasury and International Banking Director, Baba Muhammad Iqbal, Commercial Banking Director, Baba Hussein Paolo Kartajumina, Finance and Strategy Director, Baba Dafid Mirzada, Risk Management Director, and the rest of our BOD and SAVV are on the call as well. Thank you all for being here. Into this session, we will cover the following key areas, a brief of our key results as of June 25. And also digital strategies, this will be addressed by Usandra. And then, Paolo will give us an update on our liquidity position, like Baba will convey on our strategies to revive middle and small segment. And then, a detailed look into our financial performance and new key target by Baba Bolo. And finally, a review of our asset quality, risk management, and an update on our ESG implementation by Baba Dafid. Without further ado, I'd like to hand over the presentation to our directors to walk us through this morning, starting with Usandra, you may have the floor. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by sharing how BNI performed in the second quarter of 2025, along with the current challenges we are facing in this economic environment. As you know, this year has been tough for banks, including BNI. Our net interest margin has come under pressure, declining to 3.8% in the first half of the year. This is mainly because the positive competition has become very intense while the economy remains weak. Unfortunately, this has also led to a 5.6% decrease in our net profit compared to last year. But I want you to know that we are working hard to improve this situation. We are focusing on two key areas, improving our loan yields and optimizing our funding structure. I'm happy to share some positive developments. Our loan growth reached 7.1% and what's encouraging is that we are seeing better balance across our business segments. We are becoming less dependent on corporate loans with more contribution now coming from SME loans outside the KUR program. Also, our middle segment, which had been shrinking deeply, is now showing signs of recovery. In fact, we expect this segment to return to growth by the end of this year. Our commercial banking director will share more details about this later. Another area where we are making good progress is our CASA deposit. For the first time in a while, our CASA growth of 18.7% is actually outpacing our loan growth of 7.1%. This is a significant improvement from our historical pattern and shows our efforts to build a stronger deposit base are working. Finally, I want to highlight our strong asset quality, which remains one of B&I's key strengths. Our credit costs have stayed stable at around 1% and our loan at risk ratio has improved to 11% from 12.3% a year ago. This shows we are maintaining good disciplines in risk management even in these challenging times. We know there are still challenges ahead, but we are confident in our strategy and our team's ability to navigate this environment. At B&I, we are working hard to grow our low-cost deposits through digital banking and we will keep you updated on our progress. First, on B&I Direct, which is used for corporate and business banking clients, our CAS management platform, B&I Direct now serves over 200,000 users, up 20% from last year. Transaction values have grown even faster, rising 22%, helping drive an 18% increase in transactional current accounts. To make our CASA base even stronger, we are expanding beyond large corporates. With just loans, B&I Direct business this month, a version tailored for SMEs. Smaller businesses tend to hold stable balances which helps lower our funding costs over time. Lastly, on wonder apps for retail banking customers, engagement is the key. The more customers use wonder, the more their deposits grow. Wonder continues to build strong momentum with 8.6 million registered users, a 60% and a 60% year-on-year increase in transaction value, reflecting, rising user trust and platform stickiness. We've seen a clear trend that customers who use digital channels save more. Today, users rely on it for everything from QR payments to E-wall or top apps. But what excites us most is that they are starting to use wonder for investments like mutual funds and bonds. This deeper engagement strengthens their relationship with B&I and supports sustainable deposit growth. Next, our Director of Treasury and International Banking, Pa Abu Santoso, will elaborate more on previous quarter liquidity condition and its outlook in second semester. Please, Pa Abu. Thank you, Abu Aleksandra. Since the pandemic, money supply growth has slowed significantly only single digit through June this year. The situation has made it harder for banks to gather deposits, pushing the banking system's loan to deposit ratio or LDR up to 86% by June 2025. As one of Indonesia's leading banks, we take our role in maintaining financial stability seriously. Therefore, despite intense deposit competitions, we have maintained our discipline. In the first half of the year, our average LDR in at 93.6%. But by June, we are proactively build up liquidity buffers, bringing it down to 86%. This prudence came at a cost. Our funding expenses rose slightly in second quarter, also partly due to a seasonal trends. However, as we enter the second half of 2025, we see reasons for optimism. The first ones, as RBI yields and volumes are declining, easing pressure on deposit rates. Second, liquidity is improving as some of, as RBI maturity is flow back into the system. Lowering short and borrowing costs, like the Indonesia rate. Third one is a government spending is expected to pick up which could further boost system liquidity. That's it. These positive trends haven't yet translated into lower funding costs for banks. For a real sustained improvement, we'll need a combination of continued monetary easing from banks in Indonesia. Stronger physical stimulus to inject liquidity and more rational loan growth appetite across the industry. We are closely monitoring these developments and remain ready to adapt as conditions evolve. Next, our director of commercial banking will present about middle and small segment. Please, bye. Thank you, Paobu. Let me take a moment to update you on how we are executing our strategy to enhance name through targeted growth in the MSME segment. This is an important priority for us, and we have been laying the groundwork carefully to ensure sustainable success. We have made significant organizations and changes to support this initiative, including appointment of senior executive roles at the SAVV level. This is intended to develop our value chain banking capabilities and build on B&I strong relationship with large corporate clients and government institutions into commercial and SMB banking business. I want to emphasize that while we are pursuing growth aggressively, we are doing so with prudent risk management at the forefront. We have strengthened our risk framework substantially. Its business segment now has its own dedicated risk team, and we have added experienced risk provisionals across the organization. Our credit scoring system for SMEs implemented last year is already showing positive results in improving asset quality. We also improve organizational design in retail collection and recovery, enhancing productivity across all regions. The early indicators are encouraging. Our SMB non-QR learn portfolio has shown positive growth thanks to strong loan disbursement of 8.83 rupee a year today that offset run off and write off. Perhaps more importantly, our vintage analysis shows meaningful improvement in NPL performance since we introduced credit scoring. Clear evidence that we are growing this business responsibly. Looking ahead, we plan to apply these successful approaches to our middle segment, which includes our enterprise and commercial banking clients. However, I want to reassure you that we will continue to align our growth ambition with the broader macroeconomic environment. Our focus remains on achieving sustainable and profitable expansion rather than pursuing growth at any cost. This balanced approach reflects B&I's commitment to building long-term value while navigating current market conditions wisely. We are confident that this strategic investment in our MSME business will contribute meaningfully to improving our name over time. Next, our CFO will explain more about our financial performance. Please, Pablo. Thank you, Pa, Iqbal. Let us now discuss more on our financial performance for the first half of 2025. In the first six months of this year, we're defined by our focus on building a robust liquidity buffer, as mentioned by Pa Abu, to navigate the uncertain economic climate. This strategy translated to strong deposit growth of 16.5% year-on-year, well ahead of our loan growth of 7.1%. To ensure flexibility, we deployed excess liquidity into short-term, highly liquid instruments, positioning us to support loan demand in the second half of the year. Within deposits, we saw a particularly strong momentum in CASA, up 19% year-on-year, and term deposits, up 11% year-on-year. A trend that we will explore in more detail later. Turning to our profit and loss, our top-line growth was subdued with net interest income rising just 2% year-on-year, which reflected tighter margins. Non-interest income decreased by 3% year-over-year. This is caused by moderate fee income growth, delayed cash recovery's income, and the implementation of IFRS 17 in our insurance subsidiary, which weighed on revenue. We expect to see some improvement in the second half. On the expense side, we maintain strong discipline, despite higher investments in digitalization, transaction banking, and customer acquisition. Opex grew 3% year-over-year, a relatively controlled increase compared to industry peers, but still outpaced revenue growth. As a result, our pre-provision operating profit, our PPOP, declined by 1.7% year-on-year. Provisions rose 7.9%, keeping pace with loan growth as we continue to prudently build loan loss reserves in line with our risk framework. The operating environment in the first half was undeniably challenging, soft GDP growth, and global uncertainties dampened business activity and customer sentiment. These headwinds ultimately contributed to a 5.6% decline in net profit year-over-year. While these results reflect near-term pressures, we are confident that our liquidity management costs discipline and risk controls position as well for the remainder of this year. Let me briefly walk you through the key takeaways from this detailed financial overview. As we have discussed, profitability faced pressure this quarter, primarily due to compressed margins, a challenge that we are actively addressing. With that said, I am pleased to highlight several areas of strength. Asset quality remains robust, and our risk management director will provide deeper insights later on. We have made significant progress in strengthening our liquidity position with the loan-to-deposit ratio improving sharply to 86% by end of June, positioning as well for growth in the second half. Our liquidity coverage, LCR, and stable funding and SFR ratios remain solidly above 100%, reflecting prudent balance sheet management. Most importantly, our capital position remains very strong. With tier 1 car at 19.7%, post-dividend payment, and total car at 21.1%. This robust capital base not only supports our growth story ahead, but also provides flexibility for consistent dividend payouts moving forward. Our loan portfolio shows encouraging signs of more balanced growth across segments, with several strategic developments worth highlighting. The corporate segment expanded by 10% year on year, marking a more sustainable pace compared to previous year's rapid growth. This measured approach extends to our consumer book as well, which grew 10.7%, while we maintain our focus on asset quality. A deliberate choice given the ongoing industry challenges in consumer credit. Two areas demonstrate particularly strong momentum. One is commercial banking loans grew 5.5% year on year, and our SME non-KUR portfolio also increased by 9%. The KUR portfolio continues its planned contraction as we uphold strict underwriting standards with repayments outpacing new disbursements. Our subsidiaries are also emerging as a significant contributor with overall lending growth of 27%. Highbank, our commercial and SME focus subsidiary, stands out with 31% loan book expansion, accounting for about 2 thirds of our subsidiary's portfolio. Despite the strong growth rate at highbank, its NPL remains very controlled below 1%, stable on a year on year basis. Portfolio yields average 7.3% in the first half, reflecting a 20 basis point decline from last year. This primarily stems from a lower SOFR rates affecting our foreign currency loans, which comprises about 20% of the total portfolio, as well as competitive pressures that compress medium segment yields by 30 basis points. This diversified growth pattern, combined with our disciplined risk approach, creates a solid foundation for continued sustainable expansion. Building on our earlier discussion about liquidity management, I'd like to provide more color on our deposit gathering efforts. In June, we took proactive steps to strengthen our funding position in anticipation of typically stronger loan disbursement in the second half. This strategic move resulted in a 16.5% year on year growth in total third-party funds. A closer look at the composition shows particularly strong performance in our priority segments. Savings deposits, which remain our key focus, grew 10.5% year on year. Current accounts expanded by an impressive 25%, although we cautioned that our wholesale banking operations naturally see more volatility from large institutional flows. Term deposits also increased by 11% as we balance our funding mix. This front loading approach did come with some cost pressure. Our average deposit cost in the second quarter reached 2.8%, reflecting a modest increase of nine basis points, quarter over quarter, and nine basis points year over year. The upward movement was primarily driven by term deposit costs at 5.1%, and savings deposits at 1.06%, as we actively rebuild market share following the launch of WonderApp last year. The funding environment remained highly competitive throughout the second quarter, though we are beginning to see early signs of easing in the third quarter following the central bank's adjustments to SRBI policies. With our healthy LDR at 86%, we are well positioned to optimize our deposit and loan growth in the coming months while maintaining prudent liquidity management. After reviewing our first half performance, we are adjusting our full year name outlook downward by 20 basis points to 3.8% for 2025. This revised target assumes that we maintain our margins in the second half with some potential to improve. We are maintaining our loan growth guidance of 8% to 10%, with expectation of more balanced growth contribution across segments as we execute our strategy to enhance blended loan yields. And thirdly, our credit cost guidance remains unchanged at approximately 1%, as asset quality trends continue to align with our projections. For a deeper dive into our ESG initiatives, as well as asset quality metrics, I'll now hand over to our Risk Management Director, David. Thank you. Before the discussion on asset quality indicators, let me give you a brief update on our ESG initiatives. At B&I, we see ESG not as a checkbox, but as a strategic foundation. While short term ESG trend may fluctuate globally, we remain committed to integrating ESG practices as a long term failure driver for our business and stakeholders. This is reflected in our continued progress and proactive initiatives, particularly through our sustainability bond issuance and the improvement in our MSCI ESG rating. To support our ESG agenda, B&I launched a sustainability bond self offering with a total fundraising target of 15 trillion rupees of two years. In the first phase in June 2025, we successfully issued 5 trillion rupees aiming to refinance our measured green bond and reinforce our commitment to generating miserable ESG impact. This issuance is backed by strong market confidence, as reflected in its triple A rating from Peffindo. We have ensured that the use of proceeds is aligned with globally recognized standards as reviewed by Sustainalytics, which are allocated to finance and refinance eligible green and social projects. In parallel, B&I's MSCI ESG rating improved from triple B in June 2024 to A in June 2025, driven by stronger governance, risk management and environmental financing practices. This improvements demonstrate that our ESG practices are not only measuring, but also keeping pace with global standards. And now go to our asset quality. Our asset quality remains fundamentally stable, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disciplinary approach, even in this challenging economic climate. The numbers tell an important story about how we are managing portfolios across our business segments. Looking at the broader picture, we have achieved meaningful improvement in our loan address ratio, which now stands at 11% a solid 130 basis points reduction compared to last year. This progress reflects our continued focus on conservative client selection and careful portfolio management. However, we are closely monitoring developments in our consumer segment, where we have observed some emerging pressure. The segments and pair ratio currently sits at 2.1%. This is representing a 50 basis points increase year over year. The personal loan segment continues to perform exceptionally well with just a 1% and pair ratio, thanks to our payroll-based lending model that accounts for 95% of this book. From a quarterly perspective, we have noted a slight increase in the loan address ratio for our medium segment. Importantly, this movement is not concentrated in any single sector. We are seeing scattered exposures across hospitality, construction, IT services and aquaculture industries. Our risk management framework remains proactive in identifying and addressing these trends while maintaining our strict underwriting of standards. We are confident this approach positions as well to navigate the current environment while also protecting portfolio quality. A particularly revealing perspective emerges when we examine new and pale formation patterns rather than just static ratios. In the first half of 2025, we recorded 7.8 trillion rupees in loan downgrades to NPL status with a striking 76% of this originating from pandemic era or pre-pandemic underwriting. This represents a substantial 23% year-of-a-year improvement in new and pale formation, which demonstrating the effectiveness of our enhanced credit standards in recent years. The same positive trend appears in our write-off analysis. Approximately 70% of these years of 7.9 trillion rupees in write-offs stem from pre-2022 loan-fintages with total write-off declining 26% compared to the previous year. This matrix collectively validates our sharper risk assessment framework implemented post-pandemic. Our year-to-date provisioning charges total 3.6 trillion rupees representing a 1% cost of credit while we utilize 7.9 trillion rupees in reserves for write-offs during this period. Our overall reserve positions remain strong. We have maintained healthy coverage ratios with loan loss reserve representing 4.7% of total loans and pale coverage at 243% loan at risk coverage of 43%. These reserve levels we believe appropriately reflect our stable asset quality trends. Looking at credit costs by a segment refills some interesting dynamics. The corporate segment continues to show strength, allowing for some provisioning reversals due at a more modest pace than last year, driven by improving loan at risk metrics. Conversely, we have increased provisioning for the consumer segment to 2.7% up 10 basis points year-of-a-year. This is in response to emerging pressures in this portfolio. This brings us to the end of our presentation. I will now return the floor to the moderator for Q&A. Thank you. Thank you, Baba, for the insightful presentation. We will now move on to the Q&A as a reminder. You may submit your questions into the Q&A box on your Zoom app. Just a quick note, if any responses are delivered in Bahasa Indonesia, summary translation in English will follow right after. Each question will be addressed by our respective directors, and since there are several questions with the same topic, please allow us to merge the questions into one. Alright, let's begin. The first question is coming from Macquarie, GP Morgan, Spring, Smart Karma and Ox Capital. The question is what are the prospects for deposit growth and liquidity in the second half, especially post-SRBI net release, and what are the major swing factors for running costs in the second half. I would like to pass over this question to Paabu, please. Thank you for the question. We are expecting a gradual improvement in system liquidity in second half of 2025. And the unwind of SRBI placements will likely return to some liquidity to the system. Potentially supporting the deposit growth and easing pressure on the deposit rates. So we are optimistic that gradual improvement in system liquidity in second half of 2025. It will depend on a combination of a few key factors. The first one is related to the monetary policy that the decrease of SRBI ownership and yield, as well as a further rate cuts by Pang Indonesia, called EAS funding pressures, and stimulate both lending and deposit growth, particularly if the policy's stance becomes more accommodative. Historically, you know, government spending in the second half are liquidity positive. Boosting has circulations in the economy. This often leads to higher deposits inflows into the banking system. So stagnant or slow fiscal disbursements remains key down sideways. So without acceleration of government spending, liquidity injections into the system may remain limited. So while BI currently signals a pro growth stance, this could shift if global financial conditions deteriorated, particularly if external shocks trigger rupee at depreciation. Moreover, competitive pressure from other banks is also expected to play a significant role in saving, shaping a cost of an outlook for second half of 2025. As competition for liquidity intensifies, especially emititer system conditions, banks may face upward pressure on funding costs, which could impact overall margin dynamics. Therefore, we continue to closely monitor and be prepared toward any evolvements. Thank you. Thank you, Pa, before the reassuring explanations on our liquidity dynamics. I have next question, and I believe this is addressed to Paolo. The question is what is the outlook for net interest margin in the second half and also for next year, but are there any changes to our name guidance for the remaining of this year of 2025? What are the levers to improve our name, whether loan reprising, cozofans or makeshift toward higher yielding segments? Please, Paolo. Yeah, thank you for the question. So as mentioned, until the first half of this year, our name was at 3.8% due to the dynamics in the deposit market here. In light of the ongoing liquidity competition and the persistently elevated cost of funds in the first half, as we have mentioned to some investor meetings, we have revised our name guidance in this call downward. We are adjusting our full year projection from the initial range of 4.0 to 4.2% to 3.8%, reflecting a more realistic outlook for margin performance amidst a tighter funding environment. Internally, to support NIM margins, we are actively pursuing strategies to enhance low-cost funding. This is, of course, through stronger transactional CASA growth. And as we scale up our transactional CASA base, particularly through our digital platforms and cash management solutions, we expect a structural improvement in cost of funds over time. With our LDR at 86%, there is room for us to be less aggressive on special rate deposit gathering in the second half and offering lower rates for new funds. On the asset side, we are also executing a balanced asset mix towards higher yielding segments. So as mentioned, there's a more balanced growth across segments. This is particularly in consumer and MSME lending. We are doing so with prudent risk management at the forefront, including the addition of experienced risk professionals across the organization, as well as the implementation of credit scoring for SME, resulting in more acceptable asset quality improvement. We are confident that these strategic changes in our MSME business will contribute meaningfully to improving our margins over time. Thank you, Pa Bolo. While the revised guidance reflex current realities is good to hear that structural efforts, especially in the transactional CASA and balanced mix, are actively underway to support our margins going forward. I have the next question. This is coming from Kresna Hautabarath from Mandy Securities, and I believe Busandra will give us a clear answer for this one. Busandra, what is our loan growth outlook for the second half in 2025? What macroeconomics and industry factors are being considered in shaping this outlook? Please, Busandra. Thank you, Kresna, for the question. We are targeting loan growth in the range of 8 to 10% for this year. As the first half of the year, loans have grown by only 0.4% year to date, meaning we will need to grow another 7 to 9% in the second half compared to June position. In setting this target, we have taken several factors into consideration. First, liquidity availability, which we believe will not be an issue given our LDR, which has been explained earlier, stood at 86% as of June. Second, credit demand across various segments, which, while not as strong as last year, remains adequate to support high single digit growth. And we are actively engaging with corporate clients, both from private sector and SOEs. From these discussions, we have built a sizable corporate loan pipeline, especially in sectors such as agriculture, F&B manufacturing, telecommunications and transportation. We expect most of this corporate loan growth to be back-ended with the majority matter we are facing in quarter four. Third, we now have new engines for loan growth in the middle and SME segments. As presented earlier in today's earnings call, BNI is ready to scale up in these segments with infrastructure already in place, such as credit scoring implementation, organization of strengthening to capture value chain opportunities from corporate and government institution clients, enhance human resources for risk management functions and a well-structured loan management system. Thank you, Busandra, for the detailed response. The next question, what is the outlook for credit costs in the second half of 25 and also for next year? Any revisions to credit cost guidance for the remaining year? Is a sub-1% credit cost achievable through improved underwriting? I will pass over this question to Paolo. Please, Pa. Thank you for the question. Our credit cost outlook for the second half remains within our full year guidance of 1%. We do not see any need to revise this guidance. We note that there are side pressure in certain consumer segments, but the overall bang-white asset quality remains manageable. As we saw earlier, there's stable NPL and LAR levels, low-risk levels at 11% respectively. Looking ahead to next year, we aim to maintain a credit cost of also 1%, which we consider within our comfortable range and also realistic, given the current portfolio. We are seeking a balance between being conservative and growing our business, but as we have been able to maintain 1% credit costs, it is time for us to start growing in higher yielding segments. As a result, we continue to evaluate opportunities for improvement through deeper adoption of data-driven credit scoring, proactive risk monitoring and portfolio mix optimization. All of this while maintaining a prudent provisioning stance in response to the evolving macro and regulatory conditions. Thank you for the clear answer, Paolo. And since the next question is related to asset quality, I would like to address this question to Pa David. But I have a question from May not already from DBS and also from Gora, from GP Morgan. The question is, are there emerging asset quality risks, especially amidst lower growth? Is B&I seeing borrower's stress in specific segments? And is this within expectations, please part of it? Thank you. Thank you for the question. As of mid 2025, B&I continues to maintain stable asset quality and credit costs also still tracking within our guidance of 1%. New end panel formation declined by 23% year on year, and there was no major surprise downgrade. However, we have to remain vigilant amid ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. Some early signs of borrower's stress have been observed, particularly in the consumer segment, including mortgage and auto loan products, where we have seen a slight pick up in NPL. This was primarily driven by low ticket size mortgages, which have been more sensitive to macroeconomic condition and subdued purchasing power. Meanwhile, the corporate portfolio remains resilient with strong fundamentals and low NPL. With relatively weak commodity prices, we are doing closer monitoring on our portfolio. We think palm oil and coal mining exposures should not be an issue. On the other hand, we proactively help certain clients in nickel failure chain, which may need restructuring. In the SME segment, particularly non-KUR loans, we have seen improvements in asset quality, supported by the full implementation of prudent credit scoring. Overall, current stress levels are within expectations, and our provisioning and risk buffers remain adequate with 4.7% loan loss reserve, and 243% NPL coverage. Thank you, David, for the clear explanations. And the next question is related to one of the government programs, which is Village Fund, or Coprasi Danamera-Bouti, and I believe I would like to pass over this question to Ibu Sandra. This question is coming from may not arrive from the DBS booth. The question is, any concerns stemming from the exposure to this program, Goprasi Danamera-Bouti, please. Thank you. During the program design process, SOE banks have actively participated to ensure the schemes accommodate the interests of all stakeholders. A few days ago, legal framework for the program was just released. From risk management side, banks will do their own assessment on the commercial feasibility of loan proposal by taking into account the size village funds receive. This is important because the regulation mentions of credit guarantee mechanisms using village funds to mitigate default risk. We really appreciate this and see this as a strong commitment from government to ensure executing banks are able to maintain their asset quality. Liquidity-wise, we are well positioned in terms of liquidity and the scale of the programs remains within a manageable range allowing us to participate without disrupting our existing business operations. Thank you. Thank you, Busan. It's reassuring to hear that legal framework is now in place and that risk and liquidity considerations have been well addressed. Thank you. The next question is coming from Kate from Ox Capital. The question is addressed to Padafid. Padafid, please give us an update on consumer NPL formation. Please. Thank you for the question. NPL formation in consumer segment increased mostly from June last year until March this year where NPL ratio increased from 1.6% to 2%. Afterwards, the increase in NPL ratio started to slow down with only 10 bps increase in the last quarter. Looking closer on the second quarter NPL ratio, the biggest increase came from auto loan which is 100 bps higher Q on Q followed by mortgage 10 bps Q on Q while the personal loans and credit card so stable trend. We are noting that auto loan segment remains relatively small portion within our consumer portfolio. We will continue to maintain a prudent risk approach with proactive monitoring and early warning systems in place to mitigate for the risk. At this stage, we do not see any material concerns regarding consumer asset quality trends. Thank you. Thank you, Padafid. Moving on to Pablo again. I have a question from Felicia from Grow Investment and also from very from city securities. The question is what is being a medium term target for ROE given the current self macro situation. Please, Pablo. Yeah, thank you for the question. For those who have been following us for the past few years, we have mentioned about an aspiration of 18% ROE driven by low credit costs and improving NIM. On the credit cost aspect, we have hit our target of 1% cost of credit and we are committed to maintaining this going forward. On the margin aspect, as you see, we are still below our target, sending our ROE to lower than the expected level. As we all know, there are multiple factors affecting our bank's margin. From the internal side, we have been making significant progress in terms of launching our digital apps and continuing to add features which is helping to drive casa growth. However, external pressure from the macroeconomic backdrop has played quite a significant factor in the NIM challenges this year. Given the still uncertain global and domestic situation, there is quite a wide range of macroeconomic assumptions with various level of NIM and ROE implications. For us, every 10 basis point improvement in NIM leads to around 60 basis point higher ROE. Our effort to improve NIM and ROE going forward will focus on improving asset yield by growing in the MSME segment on a sustainable basis as well as consistent efforts to build transactional casa franchise. Other than that, we also intend to maintain an elevated dividend payout with tier 1 capital target of 17% from currently 19.7. This may partially help our ROE to certain extent. Thank you, Pablo. Please stand by, because I have another question for you. This is related to dividend payout, and is there any potential change under the new shareholder? This is – this question is coming from CT and also from DPS. Please, Pablo. Yeah. Last year, our dividend payout ratio was 65% from our 2024 profits. And this, of course, increased from 50% dividend payout ratio in the previous year. We do intend to maintain this level of payout ratio for the next few years, of course, subject to shareholder approval. Moving forward, this level of payout ratio will be reviewed, considering we do want to maintain a tier 1 capital of at least 17%, which we believe is appropriate to support the bank's expansion. Going forward while also maintaining the prudent capital level. Thank you for the clear answer, Pablo. I have the next question. The question is addressed to the FIT. This is from Kresna Hota Bharat, from under security spot. The question is, the Nantara has mentioned about plans to merge the construction SOEs. And if you want what that could mean to our loan at risk ratio outlook and credit cost outlook, in the second half, and also for next year, considering that B&I has heavily provisioned some of the construction SOEs loans. Please, part of it. Okay. Thank you for the question. So, I think maybe we can see this into two perspectives. One in the short term perspective. I think the merge of the construction SOEs in the short term for B&I portfolio may not change much. Even though the merger of these construction companies will be, I think it will give a positive performance for the construction companies, meaning that they will have a better revenue and also they will have a better cash flow. But I think in the short term, our outlook on the loan at risk and also credit cost may remain the same. And also our provisioning will remain the same. Because our restructuring or releasing of provision will not be, we will not release it in the short term. But in the mid-term, maybe, with the stronger performance of the construction companies and also stronger cash flow, there is a possibility that our provisioning will be reduced on these construction companies. And also maybe if the condition will be better than the collectability also may then become as a normal, meaning that we can make it better. Thank you, David. I have another question. This is from Handy from CGS Securities. And I believe this question is addressed to PABU. But the question is, have you started to see lower special deposit rate for new bidding in the month of July? What is the comfortable level of LDR in the second half of 2025? Please, PABU. Okay. Thank you, Handy, for the questions. So, basically, you know, we have seen that, you know, some normalization in special deposit rates for new bids, especially in July. And they are basically gradually, you know, trending down. Although, you know, it's selectively, you know, as you can see also, you know, our LDR. Basically, we are very comfortable in the low to mid-90s, you know, range for the second half of 2025. So, basically, this is in line with our, you know, prudent liquidity management's approach. I think that's my answer. Thank you, Handy. Thank you, PABU. Thank you, PABU, for the insightful Q&A. That concludes our presentation and also Q&A session for today on behalf of B&I's management team. Thank you, once again, for your continued trust and also for your support. Since we only have one hour, we will cover the remaining questions after this call. And should you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to our investor relations team on our email address, IR at bni.co.id. We look forward to staying connected with you on our future updates. Have a good day. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you, sir. We will now start with the Q&A session. Participants, please use the raise and feature to ask any questions. We'll just wait for a moment to question Q to assemble. We'll take the first question from Mohith Kumar. Mohith, please go ahead with your question. Hi, I'm Adi Buhal. Hi. Yes, please go ahead. Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, sir. And congratulations on a very good quarter. That's my first question is on the on the on the on the cross-block. Is it possible to share the cross-block and run it a bit of the 15.8 gigawatt capacity? So, the current so the current cross-block of the company is 89,000 crores approximately and the run rate avatar for the for the Q1. It is about 13,600 crores and on a yearly basis, it will be about 17,000 crores. So, 19,000 crores for 15.8 gigawatt capacity. Am I right? Yes. Yes. On this too, sir. My second question, sir, is it possible to share the capacity commission in value term in Q1,000,000,000,000,000,000? If I remember correctly, I think we've stored 1.6 gigawatt, correct? 1.6 gigawatt. Yes, for the current quarter, yes, we did 1.6 gigawatt. And is positive share the capacity commission in terms of value rupees crore? Yes, sir. Are you meaning revenue or you mean in terms of in terms of the Capex? So, the Capex, which are really our Capex is in the range of for the solar, it is always 4.5 crores for wind 86 and half crores. So, the current Capex for the current year booking was about 6,500 crores. So, the current quarter. My clarification on the on the accounting side, this associating come, I think you have booked in the squatter of 111 crores. Yes. Is it primarily due to Munda Green, Munda technology, that solar manufacturing? So, it's Mundra solar energy limited where we have 25% stake within that company. So, whatever that profits they generate, we get a 25% share of this. But that's that the only that the only thing which is driving the associating come, right? So, this is the only thing about manufacturing capacity, which was set up under the VPN, which was basically linked to manufacturing. But that the that's the only thing, right? There's nothing else. Yes, only thing here. My last questions are, I think we have given the target of 5 gigawatt in this in this store. And I think if I'm not wrong, I think next year we are 6, 15, 5 gigawatt, right? Given the fact that the all the most of the capacity are coming in powder, we've seen it transmission challenges, which are coming up, which which are which are causing some challenges in in commissioning these capacities. You know, it's a valid point. I think it is very difficult to tie both the things, your capacity is with the transmission capacities. There will be always some lag of of weeks or months in that process. Having said that in the current context, yes, there is a little bit of a of a challenge coming from cover evacuation. However, having said that, it's hardly less than 5% of our margins as we speak. We are very closely monitoring and supporting to a large extent how these evacuation from cover is coming up. And I and we do believe that this is clear and much before that, there will be there will be enough evacuation for us to evacuate everything. So we don't foresee a big challenge in the coming quarters, but yes, few weeks in and there, can always be an overlap in this process. Good part is that if you look at in the Q2, most of what is going to be evacuated will be rain more than the solar. And hence, that daytime challenge is also mitigated from that standpoint. I'm just to thank you and all the best. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We will take the next question from Sidant K. Sidant, please go ahead. Am I audible? Yes, please. Yeah. Good morning. Some of my first question is regarding the solar CUF capacity utilized in this quarter, we were close to 28%. But in the earlier presentations, we had mentioned that it was 32% of the cover region. So the lower CUF, this quarter is due to the early monsoon. So I think if the carter has the distinction of one of the best traditions possible, and so our CUF there is always higher. As and when the proportion of carter in the overall portfolio is going to increase, you will appreciate more and more CUF coming on the higher side in our overall portfolio. So currently, since it's only one third of it, you will find that it is much lower than the car balance. So for the portfolio projection, what should be the solar CUF be like in what will be the range? I think it will more or less stay with a few percentile points above it because of a carter, you know, more and more capacities are going to come out there. So we will have on the increasing side. So on a conservative basis, so on a conservative basis, it's fair to assume 28% like overall of course, of course, and so my second question is regarding the merchant price, like what is the average merchant price that we sold for the quarter? On a solar side, our strategy is 2.2, but the wind has been nominal equal, like 0.7, 5.7 on the wind. 5.7 on that, it's a how is this trajectory going forward because the merchant price has come down a lot for the solar side. So what is the trend that we coming up? Sorry. Can you repeat your question? Yeah, so like the trend for the solar merchant prices have gone down sharply. So going forward, like what are we projecting or how is the trend moving forward for the next two, three quarters? Will it stay around 2, 2.5 or are we seeing any uptick? You see, it is, you know, the merchant prices are always very volatile. We are not in the market of predicting the prices which comes across. Having said that, our strategy is very clear, almost all our capacities, majority are on the PPF front and so, and the other advantage which we have is that if we have some merchant capacity which are primarily coming because we are ahead of our PPAs and we are selling that capacity as a merchant, so that becomes an add-on to our overall financial model. So that's an advantage to us. But we frank to you to predict how the prices will pan out in future. It is very, it remains volatile. We do expect last year it has improved in the later part of the day. There have been pre-monsoon this time which has impacted certain solar prices and then because of operations in due to, there have been certain curtailment which we have experienced. But like I said, this is too small a window to then predict how the year will pan out of this. But we are putting steadfast in our strategy towards investing more on or building more on the PPF part and when our capacities come early, sell them on the merchant because that becomes an add-on. And so, going forwards, we have three and a half giga watt of approximate target for this year. So, when can we expect they go in Q2 and Q3? See, we are on track if you see on a five giga watt one, we have already done around one third which is expected from the next three quarters. So, if you ask me, we are very well on track for this particular capacity. You will be there with us after three months and we will share with you what we have added in the next Q2. So, just a clarity on the ISTS waiver parts about how exactly does this affect us being a renewable generator and this will be increase the tariff prices because of this. It is good to say, you know, we are not in the market of forecasting tariffs per se. All of us were aware of the fact that this particular ISTS is going on, is going to be off from the first option. And I think we all have build-over strategies based on that particular part. And ISTS has not gone off full, it still remains 75% remains, only 25% has gone off on this. We do not foresee a major change in the market pricing in the near future. Let us see how it spans out in the longer term. That you know what I am saying? Yeah, sure. I think what is important is we have built certain capacities which was part of our merchant portfolio until June. So, obviously, there is a higher advantages of those capacities. So, we could secure that for our portfolio as Ashish mentioned, the tipper down is in a time-bound manner of three years where today the tipper down is right under 5%. So, there would be some more merchant capacities we are adding now. So, these are valued in the market better than the capacity which will come later. So, we have that advantage. That advantage is realized when we do contracts with the parties because ultimately they are supposed to pay the cost. So, you will see some of those, these capacities getting advantage in the market. Right. So, I said just the line item on the sales of equipment. So, what exactly are we selling at? Is this? So, see from for the sale of equipment that we do, it is mainly from the from a standalone perspective, it is a sale to the various subsidiaries that are there. And on a console basis, it is more to do with certain group companies where we are doing certain projects for them. On that behalf, there are certain kinds of sales that happens to them. Okay. Thank you so much. But that is not having any major margin or any impact on the PNLS. Yeah. All right. Thank you so much and all the best. Answer that. Thank you. We'll take the next question from Sabri Hazarika. Sir, please go out with your question. Yeah. Good afternoon and congratulations on a good set of numbers. So, so I have two questions. Firstly, this chanting inform that is mostly wind only, right? I mean, the sale of power of around 2000 units, a million units. So, that is mostly wind or whatever the segregation like. It's a mix of total wind port and it is also pre COD power for some of our PPAs. So, what we who is obviously, there are transmission connectivity deadlines. We commission the projects much ahead of that and see that our returns in those particular projects are enhanced because of this early commissioning of projects, which are not necessarily baked in when we do the bidding. So, then we are adding that much value. So, there is revenue coming from those projects. Plus, we have pure play merchant projects where we have multiple optionalities for future. There is revenue to that. So, it's predominantly solar, if you ask me, because the ratio of projects which has a COD later is they are significantly baked into this number. On a core luncheon strategy, yes, you are right that it is tilting towards more wind projects actually taking the shape of merchant revenue in proportions move. Okay. And regarding your win, I think this UFS also like probably one of the best. So, how are you seeing the win cycle currently around cover? Do you think that we would be at a higher level compared to what it has been for the past one year, one and a half years? Somebody, it is very difficult to predict when like this time we have seen, if you look at it from from India's standpoint, we have witnessed that the wind at Rajasthan was at a lower level than the wind at Gala. Now, and since we have the better machines and a 5.2 megawatt capacities, which are the largest in the country, of course, our CUF has been the best one can imagine on this. So, we do foresee and we do expect that the forthcoming winds is going to help us. But if you are asking us to predict the wind, then it is difficult for us. But yes, and the wind will come, our CUF will remain the best as they have been showcased in the last quarter. Right. So, second question is on your other expenditure. So, there has been some restate classification. I think the foreign exchange part, I think you have clubbed it in one of the expense head. So, this 300 crore is basically what could be the adjustments. Is it foreign exchange or something else is also there? So, where are you seeing that adjustment, Sabri, you can just guide me. I will be able to then answer you. I think, I mean, you have that foreign exchange gain and loss, I think, which is part of finance costs, right? Yeah. So, see, there are two parts to it. There is a foreign exchange gain loss, which is either shown in the part of other income, which is there as a gain in this quarter, very small number. In case of the for finance cost, that foreign exchange is basically the hedging cost that we pay plus whatever the ERD that we have to value the loans, which are as ECBs in terms of those valuation, fair valuation that we do at the end of the quarter, whatever the unrealized gain loss that occurs is also part of the finance cost in that case. So, the representation basically has changed to make it very clear whatever is attributable to finance cost is now part of the finance cost only. That's right. Got it. And this increase in other expenditures basically because of capacity and increases. Yeah. So, that's proportionately based on the point and expense that goes up because of the capacity increase and various other expenses, which are part of the capacity is rising due to that. Right. Secondly, I mean, we have this, we are amidst this high mountain monsoon season, but have we seen any kind of like not, have we seen any kind of similar experience, what we faced last year or we are like much better of this time? I don't know what's here, but we mean by much better or similar experience. Yes, we have seen monsoon in the past and monsoon is again here today. It have its own, I would say impact, especially on harder, may not be to the same extent at our resistance sites. We are well prepared, much better prepared this time from the monsoon, for the monsoon, but yes, it is still going on. So, I would like to be to be there in the next call for you to actually share with you how better we were placed this time. It also depends on the furry of the monsoon. It's impact on it till early days, but yes, to reassure you, we were and we are much better placed this time from the lessons which we have of the last time, especially in powder. Just to add, so last time, if you remember, across India, the monsoon had extended by about a month or so. This time, we will have to see what happens, but normally, these occurrences don't happen, but let's see what happens. But from our side, we are better prepared. Let me reassure you on that part. Thank you so much for the detailed explanation and all the best. Thank you, Sabri. Thank you. We'll take the next question from Mahesh Patel. Sir, please go ahead with your question. Hello, I'm Audible. Yes, please, sir. My first question is on the growth of energy sales, if we see that is around 42% in this quarter of YOA, however, the revenue growth is around 30%. So, just wanted to understand, and since we have sold I think more than 40% in merchant market. So, is this because solely because of that, the lower merchant prices? Yes, predominantly, you can add it to it. So, as we earlier said, so merchant prices are fairly volatile, and it is basically part of the business case when you talk about the operating merchant. So, we have two parts. 50% of it, basically, the operating merchant and 50% is in firm revenue. So, the in firm revenue, when we have sold on merchant markets, it is basically the pre COD revenue before commercial operation rate. So, that entire revenue is incremental to whatever, basically, we were going to power under a PP of 25 years. So, it is basically an incremental to the return that we were going to make on a PP otherwise. Second part, the merchant revenues, as I said, it is volatile. Q1, it has been less because of the monsoon arriving early, and possibly the things could change in the later quarters. So, it is always volatile. So, you can't really attribute something. Second part also, the new PP is that we are implementing. Gradually, over the many years, the tariffs have gone down, and that is because of the technology evolution, and Capex going down. So, the return expectations on the PP is remaining the same, but the tariff trajectory is down, and the Capex is also down. So, these are the combination of reasons because of which it appears. So, but from a return expectations standpoint, we are not really compromising anyway. And if I can add on, you know, since the merchant rates for the wind are much better, and this is a time for better winds in India, we do expect that in this particular quarter, with more and more wind going into the merchant, with a higher rate, the proportion would be much better. So, just to again quote, merchant wind beside, the tariff is almost 5.7, which is a good tariff, I would say. I'm sorry, just add more, and especially with our CUF, things will be much better. Got it. Thank you. So, my second question is on the, because of this early monsoon answer, and since there was this solar over capacity. So, was there any back down due to the grid during, particularly during the peak solar hours that we have faced in this quarter? Yeah, we didn't mention our gear too. There have been certain back down with respect to creative equations, especially some reason, but at the current level, it is, it is less than the 5% of a little bit of margins as such. I think we had a detailed discussion, I can say our explanation on how the evacuation capacities are going to come and how we are mapping them and monitoring them so closely in that particular manner. And like I said, since in this particular part of the solar would be relatively less, and the wind would be high, we do believe, and because of the timings of the wind, which are generally more in the evening hours and in the morning hours, we don't expect that much impact on the wind part of it. And solar in any case would be lesser than the last year. So, I'll just add one more thing, I should mention this is, you know, the way transmission works in India, when our capacity is given transmission connectivity, it is given with five, six elements. So, supposing how we are asking for connectivity, it will be given us, given to us for say 1500, 2000 or 3000 megawatts, within certain elements. We are supposed to build the capacity of that much capacity by that date. Okay, so one fine day, everything is available prior to that some lesser amount of evacuation level. So, that's the nature of transmission. Now, that would obviously mean that I will set up the capacities prior to that period in a gradual pace. And I may see certain kind of lesser capacity available in the system, then what would be required for the overall number. And that is the reason you see this Google three months plus minus happening and some kind of curtailment or grid limitation coming in. But that's the nature, the way industry works, especially for people who want to finish things prior to their dates. So, that's how it may happen. Sometimes we are lucky and the system has some redundant capacities, which allows us to push an entire thing, even though the full transmission has not come in. So, these are the things which we plan much ahead. And we know what's happening, what's happening on each element and what kind of evacuation we will see. So, we know what is happening and we try to see that our capacities are aligned in a manner where we do not see big risk in this. And just to clarify, this is primarily basically pertaining to merchant and info, more with respect to your regular PTA's. And again, let me show you that the way we monitoring it, if it is not the matter of years or things like that, the capacities are coming and we are closely monitoring through this matter of weeks or months, nothing more than that. Okay, so got it. And so, one more question on the bidding strategy and the pipeline. So, do you see any major tenders like the five year award from Maharashtra last year, anything in the pipeline and what would be our bidding strategy going forward? Since we already have, I think, close to 33 gig out of logged in capacity. Yeah, so, obviously, we look at, continuously look at what are the evolving opportunities in the market. The Maharashtra one was a great tender for us to win and we could get that as part of our PTA pipeline or under construction projects. It adds significant value to what we have a portfolio. We would continue to look at opportunities where we can get that additional delta or alpha for our stakeholders. That has remained our strategy. If you see all the projects which we have won in the last few months or quarters are actually significantly value-accretive in terms of what tariffs which we have gotten in the and the way we are planning to them to execute. So, we continue to look at that and we are there in market for certain projects where we make this additional delta. And if I can add, so, on this, on this, what Raj is saying, you see, if you look at our overall target of 50 gig a watt and if we map our current portfolio, so we don't need to be very hungry and go, you know, very aggressive on the tenders. We choose the tenders, which gives us the predictable and better returns. On overall scheme of things, we are currently, as you know, is 15.8 gigs on our operations. We have more or less 16 gigs on, under execution right now. And the recent tenders which have won is another 5 giga watt out there. So, if you look at it with the overall portfolio and our target of 50 gigawatts, we have to be selective where we get the decent returns as per our benchmarks and more importantly is then execute in a manner which gives us the return which are required for it. So, it's not only just winning, it is also the matter that you win, then you execute and then you get the return. So, that's our overall strategy for it. And that's why we are not desperate. We pick where we feel is the best place for us. Got it. So, one last question. Out of this, around 33 giga watt of, you know, logged in capacity that we have, what is the capacity that is tied up under PP if you have that number? Yeah, we have. So, in the 33, you are in the, no, but I talked about 36 and a half in total, which is coming across. More than that, 31 and a half is what is currently with the PBA. So, if you total what I have told you, it will total to around 36 and a half. Like I said, but one and a half of it is under PP. And remaining is for margin purpose, right? Remaining it for the PBA, which can go under a PBA is with the C&I segment too. Okay, okay. Answer this Rani total JV, how much capacity is operational and how much is in pipeline right now? So, total 4.5 giga watt PBA we have. And out of that, roughly 4 giga watt is operational right now, in the JV. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's it from. That's right. Thank you. We'll take the next question from Puneed Gulati. Puneed, please go ahead with your question. Yeah, thank you so much. My first question is, you know, we are not seeing you in the FDRE market. You're there in wind, solar, hybrid. Is there anything we should read into that? No, I think we just said that we are very selective in what we do. And we want to see tenders where we know that the tires would happen and we would make returns better than what market is making. So, all of those are the considerations where we choose what we want, where we want to be. We are in some FDI tenders where the storage is there. So, it depends on the tender, but yes, we have over room strategy for participating and winning some events. And also any thoughts about adding battery to your currently merchant capacity? Oh, yes. And it, we are evaluating all of us right now. We have a strategy in place. You will hear from us about it. I don't think so. This is a platform for us to declare our overall strategy. But yes, we are very seriously looking towards it. We have plans towards it at a very appropriate time. You will also hear in overall context of it. But please be reassured on that part. We are done is we do things at a scale and at a level and at a time which is most appropriate for us from a return standpoint. And lastly, you talked about revenue from early commissioning of projects. Our understanding was that thing was now done away. You can't early commission. Is there some projects for which there have been some exemptions? So, it really depends on the NIPAs and how the, when are we actually commissioning and what are the conditions of such commissioning when we are commissioning them. So, I think that's what I was alluding to you earlier is that if my transmission elements are still not there, commissioning capacities, then there are certain cases where I am able to do this pre-COD power. Obviously, it is dependent on the buying party, how they look at it, how they, how what kind of conditions they want to put up for that purchase. So, it depends on PPA to PPA. What we are telling you is that we have significant capacities, which where we have been able to achieve this and where we are supplying that power on a pre-COD basis. Including in some cases to the PPA counterpart also, in both the cases, obviously, it adds revenue to the already bid out number or bid out returns, which we had. So, it's an additional earning which we are able to do. So, there is, there is no debar on this, if I can add on it. PPA has certain stipulations on which you cancel, but you are right. It is not by default that you can sell it on budget. You have to take certain approvals by both the party, but it's a part of the agreement. And you follow those procedures, take the requisite approvals and then do, one can, not only us, but anyone can sell that. And this is only where your transmission is not up. Free domain, yes. And if you can explain me the mechanics here, how does that work? If transmission is not up, how are you able to sell on the ISTS merchant? I think, actually, we can take this up separately, how the relations and rules are and how the PPA construct is separately. Probably not apt for this particular call. Oh, sure, sure, sure, separately. Okay, that's fine. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. We will take the next question from Siddharth K. Siddharth, please go ahead with your question. Sir, can you tell us what is the gross debt levels for the cotton and what was the borrowing cost? So, the gross debt for the S1, the S1 30th June is 78,000 carves. And the borrowing cost is generally, currently the range is 9.1 to 9.2% for us. And for the foliar, are we expecting it to come down? No, gross debt will not come down or show the capacity additions. The borrowing costs, yes, we are looking to refinance certain portion of our assets. So, from that aspect, we will keep on looking at it from that perspective. See, as such, because we keep on adding new construction also. So, it will not be coming down very drastically, but yes, we keep on evaluating and looking at how refinancing takes place and thereby reduce the cost to whatever extent we can from the existing operating projects. It was 9.1%, right? So, regarding the merchant price you mentioned, it was 2.2 for solar and 5.7 for the wind. What was the price in the last quarter? This is for the last quarter, the actual realization. For human means, no, he is asking for Q4. For Q4, yeah. So, see, Anna, what happens is that the wind merchant price is generally for Q3 and Q4 are generally a bit lower. So, it was in the range of about 4.7 or something in wind. And for solar, it was near 2, 3 rupees per month. It was about 3 in the Q4 of last year. And so, that's where I think it's more seasonal. And you would, you need to see pullier trends before making a view around how the prices would be. Obviously, we continuously monitor what are the demand and supply sources for the power, as well as how the weather patterns are emerging. But at the same time, it is something which is volatile and that's part of the business strategy when we say that we want to do certain capacity on the merchant side. And let me add on this, Sizan, for you. I think we should not be looking at these prices on a quarterly basis, because there is a strategic intent for the whole year. You will definitely realize that India's requirement of power, renewable power, it has its own cycles of pluses and minuses on it. So, why the solar was a bit higher in the last quarter and why it is coming? It is pretty obvious that you have more solar which will be generated in this particular quarter, which will not be the case in the future quarters too. So, while your question is valid, but you will appreciate that one look at it at the merchant, the respect to solar, and we might want to look at it for the whole year on an average, rather than on a very specific period of time. Right. So, thank you so much. Thank you. We will take the next question from Anuj Upadhyay. Anuj, please go ahead with your question. Anuj, we cannot hear you if you are. And I may not be able to hear you. Anuj, please go ahead with your question. Your line has been- Am I? Yes, yes, you are audible now. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, sorry. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, could you just elaborate on the two PSV projects in the Andhra Pradesh, which has been cancelled, you know, but kurukurti and the Krivalza PSV project. And would this cancellation have any kind of an impact on our targeted 5 giga-watt of PSV edition by FY30-31? So, that does not be very clear that does not impact our 5 giga-watt of PSV editions. We have significantly more pipelines in terms of the opportunities for which we look at execution even beyond FY30. And as well as as upsides to our current plan of 5 giga-watt, we evaluate multiple capacities and that's how something will come in and something will go out based on the results. Just to add, so from our side, we have only declared well 15 megawatt of PSP, which is for UPPCL, which is what we have won. And we have also announced 500 megawatt where we began construction in Andhra Pradesh. So, there are multiple evaluations which keep one happening. I think you have to take it into consideration only when we announce it. And when we have reached a particular stage on that. But only thing is, see this FY giga-watt or the other potentials definitely is on card, but it's only the timeline which I'm worried about. So, I think I just let me be very clear, the 5 giga-watt which we have announced and we made it very clear last time also that when we announced the capacity, those are addressed from all these considerations. So, those projects which we have announced are completely identified. They have made their own progress, whether it is in terms of rules, land rights, etc, etc. So, nothing of that is impacted. Fair point, sir. So, those 5 giga-watt will come by 30 to 31 kind of a day. Yes, there is no change in any of that. Yeah, great. Great, sir. And thank you, sir. And second is our briefing, any kind of labor issues in terms of execution? We have been hearing across other players as well, where labor availability is a concern, whether it's on the EPC front for the IPP level or the EBA question on the transmission side. So, are we facing similar kind of an issue at COVID-19 as well? And if yes, what measures are we taking to address it? Thanks Anuch. I think you have to have a sort of fact that when you are, when someone has an aspiration to grow at this level and build a project like HADA, the good part is that for us and as well as for the laborers, you have next finer horizon available with them. Important factor, if you look at it, is this transition from one project to the other. It's not that the labor is not available in this country. So, if like what we have done is that we have created infrastructure for them. Our labor colony is the best equipped. We have created infrastructure. We are giving them the facilities. So, and they don't have to move on from X to Y, typically in a solar plant, if you look at it, the challenge is that you build that solar plant in nine months time. And then again, they have to move from X to Y area. The best part of other places like KADA is that we are there for next five years for 30 gigawatt. Having created that infrastructure, having given them the facilities, I would really request and suggest, please come to KADA and look at the way we are supporting and facilitating this labor to stay, to play, having the best food for them and all the other infrastructure which we have created for them. I think having the run rate, having we don't even call our contractors, contractors, we call them partners. So, taking care of the partners who are then taking care of the labor and we are ensuring that their medical facilities, their what they are eating, where they are working, all of them are really above power from any other competitor or what you see in a solar segment in this country. And that's why I think we have been able to achieve what others take a year to build, to do it in a quarter. And I think the contribution and the goals primarily to the people who are working there, our team, our partners and predominantly the labor. Plus, the way we are taking care of the tools and technology for them, which makes their life much better when they are utilizing those automated tools while they are working on there. So, there is a lot which we are doing at the current intent and I think there is a lot more which we intend to do as we grow further at that particular area. But that's one of the reason of what we have been able to achieve so far is because of taking care of a labor with the intent and the content that I shared with you. Thank you for this Arun. The last one, just want to check on how the DCR cell efficiencies are working on. We are also hearing from many of the IPPs or developers that the DCR cells are not up to the mark in terms of the efficiency, which is VC across the imported cells. So, what higher implementation of DCRs going ahead would have any kind of an impact on the targeted efficiency of the generation which we have set aside for our projects. I think it's a question, you know, currently we don't have those in our portfolio what we are generating right now, especially in Canada and whatever we are executing. So, it's a hypothetical question for us. But believe me, from a group where we are the focus which is given on quality, I personally will not subscribe to this fact that the DCR products will be anywhere lower in their performance than anyone else. We may say that our cost of DCR may be on the higher side. But for me to commit that the performance will be on the lower side, I will not personally subscribe to it with my past experience. But having said that in the current context, we don't have that experience will not write on my part to comment on it. Fair point. That's helpful and thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Just a reminder to participants to use the raise hand feature to ask any questions. We'll take the next question from Siddharth K. Siddharth, please go ahead with your question. Hi, I said thank you. Thanks for the opportunity. And first of all, congratulations on a great set of numbers. So, while going through the earnings presentation, I saw the wind CF, which was at 42.3%, which is a very strong number. So, was it because of the early onset of monsoon, because in monsoon we usually see higher CF and also the plant availability factor was at 95.5%. So, this CF of 42.3%, was it factoring the plant availability factor, or it's the total number, like the total CF? So, I think it is first of all, I would not say that I also made it clear at our opening statement that these sites were chosen and we are very happy for what we have chosen to be, where we are building, what we are building. And what is coming out is the predictable model, which is not coming as a reality. As well as your phone question about availability to the CF is concerned, yes, do take into consideration the availability factor in place, and that's where we are. You also have to appreciate the fact that in Q1, the availability also goes low because you have a six months maintenance schedule for many of our clients. These are the new turbines and you have those credentials to do too, as well as preventive maintenance systems. Which also impacts the overall availability in that particular quarter. We have to be ready for the high wind seasons per se. Okay, so if this is adjusted for the availability factor, then the overall net CF would be much higher than this. So, yes, it is adjusted for the availability factor. See, what Ashish was telling is ahead of monsoon season, all wind turbines in the country has a practice of being overhauled, so that they work on a much better basis in the real wind season, which comes in the monsoons. That's where you will see that availability in this period is slightly lower because it has a monsoon thing. Second, even the best benchmarks in case of wind, because it is a moving equipment. So, turbines have an availability factor of 96 to 90, 96 or 96 and a half or percent for the full year, because these are moving things and needs more maintenance than a solar plant where availability can be as good as what you see in our thing, which is around 100%. So, that's what the thing is. Yes, mathematically, if you had not taken any maintenance or upkeep kind of a shut down, yes, the number could have been higher. Great. Thank you, sir. That's it from my side. Right. Thank you, Siddharth. So, just to answer, I have a couple of questions from my end. First is on BESS, and I knew you talked about it, but I just wanted to understand how you are thinking about this from a five-year perspective, especially when there are other players who are quite aggressive on that front. When we told you, we have a strategy in place, and like I said, it's not a 50-meter run that we are making it across. For us, renewable is a long-term perspective. We are, very closely, if we have looked into the technologies, we have looked into, we are much better placed than most of the competitors if you see across. With our capacities across India, with the way our plants are performing, and I'm only saying, hold on yourself, there is a strategy in place, there is a plan in place, and like I told you, at Adani, we do it at a speed and a scale which is unprecedented. We should be in a position to share with you in some time of it. And then, sir, thank you. Secondly, I wanted to know your thoughts on renewable energy demand from data centers, and just wanted to understand how discussions are going on with these players, especially MNCs, and what kind of contracts you are getting into, what kind of growth runway you see in that area? Yes, sure. So, that's a pretty interesting market, and with the way data is being now hosted in India, for India's consumption, as well as the new AI demand, as well as the focus of some of these data centers to actually have green power. It's a significant opportunity for us, and that's where you see in our rural mix for FY30, we have said that 25% of our capacities would be seeing some of these kind of markets. So, it's pretty much part of our focus area as a potential source of uptake. And there is a keen interest from the some of these data centers. Right, sir, and the contract should be long-term, or do they refer to procure on spot basis? So, it depends on the buyer and the seller. A lot of these guys want to do a 10-year contract or a 15-year contract, because that's kind of a visibility you may see in their own industry. Obviously, the risk-adjusted value, which comes to both the sites, needs to reflect that, and that's what happens in some of these contracts. So, spot market is obviously 10. There is nothing as a contract. They will secure some short supplies. We are there in that market as well. The pricing reflects the well, not the 10-year in that case. So, all of that is something which is a trade of a B2B market. So, I think as a company, we are ready to create that exposure, and that's where we are saying that 25% of the capacity will be available in the merchant exposure, C&I, CFDs, or mixed hybrid contracts. Sure, I understood very helpful. So, last question from we have written in the chat box, says, can you please comment on the quarterly swings in the NCI line? How much of the NCI capacity is yet to be commissioned and any timelines for the same? So, see, out of 4,500 capacity with total in as a joint venture, about 4,000 odd capacity has already been commissioned, and another 500 is in bike line decommissioned by next six months to one year. So, after that swing from that perspective should be minimal, except for the distributions and the other things that just to make it clear, see, the way a renewable profile works is that your profits will keep on increasing as you go towards end of the project life, because your interest cost initially is higher and it keeps on reducing. So, that trend will be followed, but other than that, the 4.5-year portfolio that we have under the TV, that will have basically a stable kind of an evil type, at least I will say. Pat will keep on changing. Thank you, sir. That would be it. Over to you for any closing remarks. No, I think it's. Thank you, everyone. I really appreciate your interest in our organisation and the support which you have been providing to us. I think we are very happy what we have achieved in the Q1, and I think the team is committed to take it further on our overall target, which we have shared with you about 5.1. We are on track of it, interpredictable returns from our side. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you very much for being with us for any further questions. Thank you, by you, and the quality for organising this talk. Thank you.
