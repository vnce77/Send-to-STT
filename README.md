I'll now turn the call over to Verrica's President and CEO, Jayson Rieger.
Jayson Rieger
Thank you, Kevin, and good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for
our first quarter 2025 corporate update call.
I'm pleased to report that our focused commercialization strategy is helping to
drive increased demand for YCANTH. On April 7, we pre announced strong
sequential growth in the first quarter with YCANTH dispensed applicator units
increasing 16.7% over the fourth quarter of 2024 and rising above 10,000 units
per quarter for the first time since the launch of the product.
As announced today, this also resulted in $3.4 million in revenue for the quarter.
I'm further excited to say that we have seen momentum build throughout Q1
and are working to continue to capture that momentum.
As demand for YCANTH by pediatricians, dermatologists and other healthcare
professionals and their patients continues to grow, we believe YCANTH
distributor inventory levels have normalized and we expect that dispensed
applicator units will now more closely track to our revenues. Importantly, we are
executing on our commercial strategy as a much leaner and more capital
efficient company, which I believe will place us on a strong and sustainable
growth trajectory.
In parallel with our commercial progress, Verrica's clinical stage pipeline also
continues to advance. We continue to work with our development and
commercialization partner, Torii Pharmaceutical to initiate our Phase 3 program
of YCANTH in the treatment of common warts.
Meanwhile, we continue to advance our novel oncolytic peptide VP-315, which
has shown promising safety and efficacy data in Phase 2 trial for the treatment
of basal cell carcinoma, having recently held an end of Phase 2 meeting with
the FDA to discuss the design of our Phase 3 program. Given the significant
unmet need for both of these indications, we believe developing these programs
has the potential to significantly grow the value of our company.
I will now provide a more detailed update on our commercial activities for
YCANTH. During the first quarter of 2025, the full effects from our revised
commercialization strategy, which we began to implement in Q4 of last year,
helped drive demand for YCANTH. As we have previously noted, we initially
focused on territories with high prevalence of molluscum and established strong
insurance coverage. The productivity of our sales force also improved
substantially during the first quarter.
Our average dispense applicator unit per selling day continues to trend
favorably, giving us additional confidence that our new commercial strategy is
working. To that end, we have recruited new sales representatives to work in
new territories, splitting certain large markets and entering other new markets to
capitalize on improving demand.
Throughout the first quarter, we also continued adding local independent
regional pharmacies to our strong relationships with our National Specialty
Pharmacy Partners. Our approach to distribution of YCANTH has been to focus
where physicians and other healthcare professionals prefer to write
prescriptions and we've seen strong adoption to this approach since the
relaunch.
As previously noted, YCANTH inventory levels appear to have normalized, as
we are seeing multiple orders each month from our distribution partners rather
than larger infrequent stocking orders.
Going forward, we believe shipments of YCANTH Applicator units will more
closely reflect the underlying demand from physicians and patients and the
disclosure relationship will translate into steadier revenue growth as we
continue the relaunch.
Finally, our cost cutting measures have taken hold and our quarterly expenses
are reflective of that. We would expect that going forward we will selectively add
to sales personnel in geographic areas where we have good coverage but no
representative and add additional sales representatives in markets where there
are enough potential customers to warrant multiple representatives in that
market.
I'd like to now also provide a brief update on our clinical stage pipeline. As
previously reported with respect to YCANTH, our Japanese development and
commercialization partner, Torii Pharmaceutical, filed in late 2024 a new drug
application in Japan, seeking approval of YCANTH, designated in Japan as TO-
208 for treatment of molluscum.
With an estimated over 1.6 million patients in Japan alone, molluscum
represents a significant market opportunity for YCANTH. And we look forward to
Torii sharing updates on the regulatory approval process later this year.
We are also working with Torii to relaunch to launch a global Phase 3 study
evaluating YCANTH in the United States for TO-208 in Japan for the treatment
of common warts. Verrica remains eligible to receive a milestone payment of $8
million upon the initiation of this study, which could begin as early as mid-2025.
As we previously stated, the cost of this study will be split 50-50 with Torii, but
Verrica's portion will be paid by Torii and reimbursed by Verrica at a future
milestones and transfer price payments.
Regarding our Phase 3 ready clinical oncology asset, VP-315, which we are
developing for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, as previously disclosed in
January, a post hoc analysis of data from our Phase 2 -- or Part 2 of our Phase
2 study demonstrated treatment with VP-315 led to a calculated objective
response rate or OOR of 97%. OOR was defined as the percentage of study
subjects who did not demonstrate disease progression and who experienced at
least 30%reduction in tumor size along with a partial or complete response
following treatment.
We believe positive preliminary top-line results from our Phase 2 study suggest
that VP-315 has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with
basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer.
As noted on our fourth quarter call, we expect to announce additional genomic
and immune response data for VP-315 in mid-2025. We are also encouraged by
our recent end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. After reviewing the final
meeting minutes and this additional data, we plan on providing a global
development program update later this quarter.
Finally, I would like to mention recent appointments to our senior management
and Board of Directors. In March, we announced that Dr. Noah Rosenberg
joined Verrica team as our new Chief Medical Officer. Noah is a highly
accomplished pharmaceutical executive and physician who brings deep
expertise in both drug development and commercialization. As CMO, he will
play an instrumental role in advancing of our goal for YCANTH to become the
standard of care for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and in advancing
our clinical stage programs.
Following Noah's appointment in early April, we welcome Dr. Gavin Corcoran to
our Board of Directors. Over his career, Gavin has built an outstanding track
record of developing and launching innovative medicines as well as creating
significant value through strategic transactions. As we execute our strategic
objectives, his expertise will help guide us in our decision making and look
forward to working with him as we enter our next phase of growth.
I will now turn the call over to our Interim Chief Financial Officer, John Kirby, to
review our first quarter 2025 financials.
John Kirby
Thanks, Jayson. In the first quarter of 2025, we reported total revenues of $3.4
million which was substantially all YCANTH revenue. Net YCANTH revenue
reflects shipments to our distribution partners offset by standard gross to net
adjustments including actual or anticipated product returns, off invoice
discounts, distribution fees, co-pay programs and other rebates.
Collaboration revenues totaling $17,000 in the first quarter of 2025, which
related to our supply of applicators to Torii in connection with their development
and commercialization activities.
Gross product margins for the first quarter of 2025 were approximately 88%.
Cost of product revenue of $0.4 million included $47,000 of obsolete inventory
cost. Research and development expenses of $2.3 million in the first quarter of
2025 decreased versus the first quarter of 2024 by $2.6 million driven primarily
by $2.1 million decrease in clinical trial expenses related to VP-315 as well as
costs related to a decrease in regulatory and medical affairs expenses of $0.4
million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $8.8 million in the first quarter of
2025 decreased versus the first quarter of 2024 by $7.5 million driven primarily
by the implementation of our more focused commercial strategy for YCANTH.
GAAP net loss was $9.7 million or $0.1 per share for the first quarter of 2025
compared to a GAAP net loss of $20.3 million or $0.44 per share for the first
quarter of 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based
compensation, non-cash interest expense and change in fair value of
embedded derivatives, the first quarter of 2025 net loss was $7.8 million or
$0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $17.8 million or $0.38 per share for
the first quarter of 2024.
And finally, as of March 31, 2025, Verrica had aggregate cash and cash
equivalents of $29.6 million. Under GAAP, the cash and cash equivalents as of
March 31, 2025, would not be sufficient to fund operations for the one-year
period following the release of our financial statements. However, should Verrica
receive $8 million milestone payment from Torii triggered by the initiation of the
Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan for common warts or should we receive a portion
of the $25 million in proceeds from the exercise of Series A warrants issued as
part of our November 2024 equity financing, which expire in November of 2025,
we could have sufficient cash to fund operations for such periods.
Nonetheless, we will continue to apply discretion in our use of cash and explore
opportunities to further bolster the strength of our balance sheet, while still
advancing our commercial and clinical development efforts.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jayson for closing remarks.
Jayson Rieger
Thanks, John. Based on our focused commercialization strategy and more
capital efficient operating structure, I believe Verrica remains on a pathway for
strong and sustainable growth. The positive feedback we are receiving from the
field also tells us that brand recognition for YCANTH continues to grow amongst
both dermatologists and pediatricians. In addition, we see patient access
continuing to improve along with strong and predictable reimbursement from
Medicaid and commercial payers, all of which we believe point towards
YCANTH becoming the new standard of care for the treatment of molluscum
contagion.
As YCANTH continues to grow, our late-stage pipeline provides another exciting
source of value for our company and shareholders. We believe our program in
common warts and basal cell carcinoma each hold significant potential value,
and we look forward to providing updates on these programs in the near future.
With that, we would now be happy to take any questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll move first to Stacy Ku with TD Cowen.
Your line is open.
Stacy Ku
Hey there. Thanks so much for taking our questions and congratulations on
your Q1 performance.
So first, maybe could you further discuss your success in targeting
pediatricians, maybe talk about the current split of pediatric derms versus
pediatrics, writing YCANTH? So that's the first question.
And then the second question, maybe as we think about the summertime,
potential increase in molluscum patients, what kind of preparation is ongoing to
really capture these patients? And do you expect YCANTH show some
seasonality as it relates to patient demand as we kind of enter the summer
months?
And then last question is on 2025 full year. Consensus is around $15 million. So
would love to hear your thoughts around the Q1 performance and how it relates
to the rest of the year. Maybe talk about the dynamic between patient demand
and maybe some additional pull through of inventory. It sounds like it's stable.
So just want to make sure we have that correct.
Thank you so much.
Jayson Rieger
Thanks Stacy. This is Jayson. I appreciate the questions. And if I don't answer
all your questions, please track me down for anything I left off. In terms of split
between derms and peds, we're seeing an ever-growing number of pediatricians
writing the product, but still large percentage of our customers are the derms
and they still remain strong advocates of our product and users of the product.
So I would say rather than the dynamic splitting, we're seeing growth in both,
which is very exciting for the penetration of the product, but also the availability
of it for the patients.
In terms of the summer months, it's kind of interesting that you asked that.
There tends to be modest speculation on seasonality for molluscum, although
as the weather does get better and kids are outside more, commonly go into
pools where molluscum can be transmitted with sharing of towels, etc. There
may be some seasonality uptick. We are doing a fair amount of sort of
marketing to clinicians and some via social media activities to sort of continue to
build awareness for molluscum as a disease, but also that YCANTH is available
for treatment for the patients. So I think that's going to continue to contribute to
the growth of YCANTH penetration in the units that we're dispensing.
And in terms of 2025, for full year consensus and guidance, I appreciate you
asking that. The company at this point is not going to give guidance for the year.
We will continue though, however, to share the number of dispensed applicator
units. We'll try to update that on a quarterly basis when that information
becomes available and share the revenue during our quarterly filings.
As you can see, this quarter, we did see meaningful revenue and dispensed
applicator units. And as our distributors are ordering more frequently and in
smaller quantities, those numbers should mirror each other much closer going
forward, and we hope to continue to see the momentum that we saw the end of
last quarter continue to rise in this quarter as well.
Stacy Ku
Okay, wonderful. Thanks so much.
Jayson Rieger
Thanks, Stacy.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Gregory Renza with RBC Capital Markets.
Your line is open.
Gregory Renza
Hey, guys. It's Anish on for Greg. Congrats on the progress this quarter and
thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple from us. First, how are you
thinking about the conversion time between accounts receivable and top line
revenue for YCANTH? How has that been trending and likely to trend through
the rest of the year?
And second, as we think of accessibility, you previously mentioned expansion
into pharmacy benefit. Can you just help us think about how this will improve
access for YCANTH versus previous periods? Thanks so much.
Jayson Rieger
So yes, so in terms of the accounts receivable, it's interesting you noticed that.
So we do offer 60-day payment terms to our distributors. As the product is
pulling through and then they're passing it through, as we've normalized the
inventory levels, we expect that to semi stabilize and sort of be continue to
generate cash going forward. And because we're getting smaller orders and
more frequent orders, that should stabilize in terms of conversion to cash from a
receivable.
In terms of the pharmacy benefit, I would say the mix of our business continues
to grow both on the pharmacy distribution side as well as the medical benefit,
which is the buy and bill approach. We see growth in both sides of that
business. And particularly on the pharmacy side, we've added a number of
independent pharmacies, which has proven to be a convenient mechanism for
some clinicians to order the product, have it right bagged back right to their
office and treat their patients, in addition to those who prefer to do the buy and
bill model and have it on hand that same day.
So we've seen it both and our commercial team has done an excellent job of
expanding our benefit coverage. So I would say that we have robust now
coverage growing in both Medicaid and commercial across both of the
pharmacy and the medical benefit.
Gregory Renza
Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color.
Jayson Rieger
Yes, no problem.
Operator
We'll move next to Serge Belanger with Needham and Company. Your line is
open.
Serge Belanger
Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. First on patient access, just a follow-
up on the prior question. When you're looking at the overall TAM for molluscum,
how should we look at the split between commercial and Medicaid coverage for
the indication?
Jayson Rieger
So we would say that in the pediatrician world, there's a large percentage of
pediatric patients that are covered under the Medicaid. There's going to be a lot
of dependency on state as well. And then on the Derm side, there's a higher
percentage of commercial pay, but there are obviously commercial and
Medicaid on both sides. But we're seeing growth on both sides of that across
states where we have good robust coverage.
Serge Belanger
Got it. And then maybe a quick one for John. Just where currently are gross-to-
net and where do you think they'll get to once we get to kind of a more steady
state level?
John Kirby
So Serge, I don't think we've spoken directly to the gross-to-net split. But if you
look at the number of applicator units and that as it's tracking to aligning with the
sales demand that we've reported, you could do the back of the envelope math
to get to the rough percentage.
Serge Belanger
Got it. Thanks.
Operator
We'll move next to Kemp Dolliver with Brookline Capital Markets. Your line is
open.
Kemp Dolliver
Great. Thank you. Couple of questions. What are you seeing in terms of
reordering and then also number of applicators per patient?
Jayson Rieger
So the reordering actually is a very interesting aspect of the business that we're
tracking very closely. And historically, I would say a larger percentage of the
reorder -- there was the growth in the business or stabilization of the business
was a mix of loss of old -- loss of accounts that were not reordering and sort of
bringing up new customers.
In this last quarter, we're starting to see a solid growth and retention of
customers that have been here and ordered previously and continuing to
reorder. And that's a fundamental part of our business model, which means
likely that the clinicians are having a positive experience, both in acquisition of
the product and treatment of their patients and using it as a going forward part
of their practice for the treatment of patients with molluscum.
Kemp Dolliver
And any comments on the applicators per patient?
Jayson Rieger
So we're not giving you a specific guidance on that. In our clinical study, we
allowed for up to 4 applicators – 4 treatment cycles to be used. I would say
clinically as we saw originally, we're probably closer to the 2 to 3 treatment
cycles, where clinicians are feeling their patients are achieving the medical
benefit that they are desiring.
Kemp Dolliver
Great. Thank you. And what are trends you're seeing in sales force turnover? I
mean, you are starting to rebuild the sales force, but have you seen turnover
level off? Are you seeing less involuntary turnover, etc.?
Jayson Rieger
I would say we're seeing in this industry there tends to be some turnover. We're
seeing some very solid retention of our core performers and quite a bit of
interest as we post some openings for both expanding in existing territories
where we have demand or territories where new demand is growing. So we're
excited about our team and maintain we're trying to maintain a relatively stable
number to where we were after our reduction in force last year and may
incrementally grow as the areas we're trying to target grow and or there's
additional demand. So that's been a very, very positive impact on that front.
Kemp Dolliver
Great. Thank you.
Operator
And this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now
like to turn it back to Jayson Rieger for any additional or closing remarks.
Jayson Rieger
Thank you, operator. I'd just like to thank everyone for joining the call this
evening. We look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout
2025. Have a nice evening.
