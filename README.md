This conference call will be available on our website at axt.com through October 30, 2026. I also want to note that shortly following the close of market today, we issued a press release reporting financial results for the third quarter of 2025. This information is available on the investor relations portion of our website at axt.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Fisher for a review of our third quarter 2025 results. Gary? Thank you, Leslie, and good afternoon to everyone. Revenue for the third quarter of 2025 was 28.0 million compared with 18.0 million in the second quarter of 2025 and 23.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. To break down our Q325 revenue for you by product category, Indian FOSVIDE was 13.1 million, primarily from data center and PON applications. GALI Marside was 7.5 million, germanium substrates were 640 K, and revenue from our consolidated raw material joint venture companies, and Q3 was 6.7 million. In the third quarter of 2025, revenue from Asia Pacific was 87 percent, Europe was 12 percent, and North America was 1 percent. The top five customers generated approximately 45.2 percent of total revenue, and two customers were over the 10 percent level. Non-GAP gross margin in the third quarter improved substantially to 22.4 percent, reflecting improved product mix and higher volume to absorb overhead. For comparison, we reported 8.2 percent gross margin in Q2 of 2025, and the 24.3 percent gross margin in Q3 of 2024 last year. For those who prefer to track results on a GAP basis, gross margin in the third quarter was 22.3 percent compared with 8.0 percent in Q2 of 2025 and 24.0 percent in Q3 of last year. We continue to be highly focused on driving continued improvement, including further recovery in Q4. Moving to operating expenses, given the difficult climate, we've been working hard to hold down OPEX. In addition, we had some favorable adjustments in R&D and Q3 that brought our OPEX down to a lower than normal level. These will not carry over into Q4. Therefore, our total non-GAP operating expense in Q3 was 6.7 million, compared with 7.6 million in Q2, and 8.3 in Q3 of 2024. On a GAP basis, total OPEX in Q3 was 7.3, compared with 8.2 million in Q2, and 9.1 million in Q3 of 2024. Our non-GAP operating loss for the third quarter of 2025 improved substantially to $384,000, compared with the non-GAP operating loss in Q2 of 2025 of 6.1 million, and the non-GAP operating loss of 2.6 million in Q3 of 2024. For reference, our GAP operating line for the third quarter of 2025 was a loss of 1.1 million, compared with an operating loss of 6.7 million in Q2, and an operating loss of 3.4 million last year in Q3. Non-operating other income and expense and other items below the operating line for the third quarter of 2025 was a net loss of $46,000. The details can be seen in the P&L included in our press release today. For Q3 2025, we had a non-GAP net loss of 1.2 million, or 3 cents per share, compared to the non-GAP net loss of 6.4 million, or 15 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2025. Non-GAP net loss in Q3 of 2024 was 2.1 million, or 5 cents per share. On a GAP basis, net loss in Q3 was 1.9 million, or 4 cents per share. By comparison, net loss was 7.0 million, or 16 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2025. GAP net loss in Q3 of 2024 was 2.9 million, or 7 cents per share. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for Q3 2025 was 4 to 3.8 million shares. Cash and cash equivalents and investments decreased by 3.9 million to 31.2 million as of September 30th. By comparison, at June 30th, it was 35.1 million. Accounts receivable increased by 11 million, so the delta in cash is explained in working capital. Appreciation and averageization in the third quarter was 2.3 million, total stock comp was 0.7 million. Net inventory was down by approximately 2.4 million in the third quarter to 77.7 million. This continues to be a focus, and we expect to bring it down further in quarters to come. This concludes the discussion of our quarterly financial results. Turn into our plan to list our subsidiary, Tongmei and China, on the star market in Shanghai. We continue to keep our IPO application current. Tongmei remains in process as a part of a much more selective and smaller group of prospective listings than a few years ago. Although the current geopolitical environment is dynamic, Tongmei is considered a Chinese company and continues to be regarded in China as a good IPO candidate. We will keep you informed of any updates. With that, I'll now turn it over to Dr. Moore's young for review of our business and markets. Moore's. Thank you, Gary. This has been a very eventful quarter for AXE, as we are seeing a strong uptake in any fast-right demand from data center applications globally. And as our industry and our customers adapt a new normal, rapidly changing environment. In Q3, our revenue grew 56% sequentially, 18% year over year. Within this, our Indian fast-right revenue grew to our highest level since 2022. As we were successful in obtaining actual permits for a number of significant Indian fast-right orders throughout the quarter. I'm very proud of the diligence our team and grateful for the partnership of our customers in working through the export control permitting process. Our current experience is that our Indian fast-right permits are taking approximately 60-bit business days or approximately three months to be processed by China's Ministry of Congress. This is a bit longer than our initial expectations, but customers are adapting to the requirements and are adjusting their ordering patterns to give us more visibility and longer lead times. I should also note that the Golden Week holiday at the beginning of October in China will likely increase the average permit processing time by a week or so in Q4. The tremendous growth in demand for Indian fast-right based lasers and detectors for high-speed optical connectivity coupled with our successful obtaining export permits on behalf of our customers are driving a strong increase in our Indian fast-right order backlog, which as of today is more than $49 million and growing. Our established customers are planning for longer lead times by placing longer-term orders and giving us more visibility into their expected demand. We are also seeing active engagement with several tier one, new tier one customers to qualify our material into their supply chains for the first time in many years. This includes leading optical transceiver module makers, both in China and around the globe. As many of you know, the supply chain for optical transceiver is quite complex and highly globalized. We believe this geographic interdependence is providing both opportunities and incentives for the ecosystem to work together in new ways to solve global supply chain shortages. For a geographic demand perspective, the massive AI infrastructure built out and the planned CAPAC spending by cloud services and AI platform providers in the United States is the primary driver for EML and Silicon Photonic Space to optical transceiver. We believe that today our material are being used in multiple U.S. hyperscalers and we expect that end customers use will continue to broaden. In China, the data center built out is early in its RAM, but there is a strong desire for domestic suppliers at every level of the supply chain and we believe over the next 12 to 8 months, we will see healthy growth in the China data center market. Data center expansion in China is quickly overtaking power as the leading application in China for our Indian fossil substrates, giving the strong demand environment. It is important to know that AIC is well positioned to handle increased demand with ample manufacturing capacity in place today and we can also significantly increase our output by current level and we can also add capacity quickly as needed. We also have a demonstrated ability to supply very low EPD wafers in volume that meet the biggest requirements of next generation EML and Silicon Photonic Space devices. Now turn into galling us tonight. Our revenue grew more than 20% from the fire quarter. The biggest driver was some easily in wafers for wireless RF devices which remains a focused application for us. Industrial laser applications were about flat from Q2 and we saw an EPTI semi-conducting wafers for data center laser applications. However, VIXO lasers don't typically require a lot of galling us and material, so they don't move the needle much as a growth driver, but they do require high quality material which will well position to supply. In Joomini substrates, our sales declined by about a million dollars in Q3, the Joomini substrate market was very poor growth margin potential today. And while our material performed well in the solar cell applications as we supplied, growth margin constrained this incentivizes to pursue many opportunities. In addition, certain other customers prefer to source substrates outside of China. As such, we do not expect growth in the remaining substrates in Q4. Finally, our raw material business in Q3 was consistent with the prior quarter and it was solidly profitable within a stable pricing market. We expect the same for Q4, globally, there continues to be a greater awareness of the importance of earth materials and we are ahead of the curve in developing this unique integrated supply chain. In closing, this is a highly active time for our business. The receipt of any phosphide and galling us in our export permits remains the single most significant gating factor for our growth. As such, we are highly focused on ensuring that we are proactive, organized and disciplined about managing the process on behalf of our customers. We also know that we must be laser focused on running our business with the greatest efficiency. This includes our continued effort to drive growth margin improvement, our backs discipline and inventory reduction. We strive ongoing market trends, fueling the data center upgrade cycles. We believe we have tremendous opportunity in 2026 to drive meaningful growth in our business and a return to profitability. We look forward to reporting to you our growth progress. With that, I will turn the call back to Gary for our fourth quarter guidance. Gary, thank you. Thank you, Morse. To reiterate a couple of key points for Morse's commentary, we are seeing a strong increase in our Indian phosphide wafer demand related to AI and the ongoing data center upgrade cycle. Given the geopolitical complexities surrounding this market trend, customer behaviors in our space are changing to allow for longer substrate lead times. Our customers are placing longer term orders and providing greater visibility into their needs. As such, our Indian phosphide backlog has grown to $49 million and is the largest we've ever had in our history. Further, we are actively engaging with new customers today that we have had not had business with an opportunity for some time. With all of these positive market and AHT specific growth drivers, the most significant gating factor in our growth in Q4 and beyond is the success and timing of getting export permits. Therefore, guiding for the future is somewhat tricky for us right now as we cannot predict future timing of permits or our success in obtaining them for any customer or individual order. But drawing on what we know and have what we've experienced this far in the export permitting process, we can offer the following insight into our expectations for Q4. As of today, we have approximately $20 million in revenue that can be realized in Q4 across our substrate product lines and raw materials for which we either already have a permit to ship or for which an export permit is not required because it ships within China. We have a high degree of confidence in recognizing this revenue in Q4. In addition, we believe there's an incremental $7 million to $10 million in Indian phosphide and gallium arsenide backlog which is currently in our manufacturing process for which we believe we may be able to ship in Q4 if we are awarded permits. Of course, timing of permits is not within our control, but we believe we are in a similar or slightly better position in terms of customer order backlog and permit submissions than we were at the same point in the prior quarter. As such with that as background, we believe we have the capability to achieve revenue in the range of $27 million to $30 million in Q4 subject to the caveats I just mentioned. This takes into consideration approximately flat sequential revenue contribution from germanium substrates and raw materials with incremental growth in Q4 likely coming from Indian phosphide and gallium arsenide substrates. As Morse mentioned, we continue to focus strongly on gross margin. We made significant gains in Q3 and continue to work on our manufacturing efficiency. Further improvement in Q4 depends on a number of factors including total revenue as it relates to the absorption of PICS costs, revenue mixed by product, and our ability to continue to drive better manufacturing efficiency. With regards to OPEX, we expect that it will increase to approximately $9 million as a result of some incremental end of the year adjustments and a return to a more normalized level. With these factors in mind, we believe our non-GAP net loss will be in the range of $0.1 to $0.3 and our GAP net loss will be in the range of $0.3 to $0.5. This represents substantial year-over-year progress towards our return to profitability. We estimate the share count for Q4 will be approximately $43.8 million shares. Okay. This concludes our prepared comments. We'll be glad to answer your questions now, operator, Calvin. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. I would like to remind everyone to ask a question, please press the star button followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star one again. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Charles Shee of Needham and Co. Please go ahead. Hi. Morris, Gary, congrats on receiving the licenses of the permit shipping 8 million additional revenue in a quarter and a congrats again on the $49 million backlog that was an exciting number to hear. We don't want to get back to this point. The customer behavior change, like are they placing longer-term orders, but I think if I hear you correctly, some of those customers may not necessarily have the permit at this point and still proceed to place the orders with you, a pretty significant amount of orders with you. Can you kind of talk to what exactly is driving that behavior and what do you think of the actual permits, the current ones you already have? Are there time limits to that? Are there the volume limits to that? What could be your best prediction going forward from here that customer behavior can continue to evolve? Thank you. Tim? Yes. Thank you, Charles. So, we have, as you say, a $49 million backlog. That includes customers that have previously received permits and customers that are still in their permit phase for the first permit as we go through. Everybody that has previously received a permit has typically received subsequent permits from there. So, there's a lot of confidence in getting further permits as we move forward through this. So, people are placing orders into that backlog with the understanding that the confidence levels of receiving permits are high, especially for Indian FOSFIDE. So, as we look forward and as we look at that backlog, all of the orders that we've received and put into backlog have permit applications in place so far. And we manage that backlog in those permit applications and we manage the manufacturing process. So, that we can combine the expected permit approval time with the finishing of the product. So, I'll leave time to ship the product after receiving the permit is very low. Yeah. But, so, maybe I can add, and at other point, I hear Charles is asking, is there any relationship with customer giving us a lot more order, a lot longer order lead time, is it because we have a permit process? I think that is true. People realizing, except adjusting time, they want to give us a long lead time to submit the permit application so that we can ship this product to them in time. Is that a part of the question, Charles? Yes. I think it may be a better way to help us understand the permit to the size of the orders, the how much long-term the orders is going to be. Maybe you can ship some light, let's say, the order currently on average cover is like a one-year demand, two-year demand, three-year demand. What do you see there? Like how long does the order you're popping the backlog of cover is what customers do you have? Right. Okay. I understood. Thanks, Charles. So, the permit, we apply for a permit and it can be for multiple shipments, number of shipments up to 12, this is the important part, the permit only lasts six months. Yeah. So, everything has to be shipped within six months of receiving the permit. Yeah. And the other point is this, our customer are telling us, we give you this order, if you get the permit and if you can manufacture it, you can ship it tomorrow. So, when Tim mentions up to 12, that means 12 light items. Every P.O. needs a separate permit. So if you put each line item on a separate P.O. then we need 12 permits. Yeah. It's complicated as they say in the show business. It is. It is. So, maybe I asked another question on profitability. So, when you were at this revenue level in the high 20s, going back a few years, you probably have a gross margin somewhere in the high 20s or even low 30s percent and you would have a non gap APF in the positive territory. But I think Gary, if I hear you right, I think you are expecting some gas, some non gap loss in the coming quarter. And I wonder if there's anything, you know, cost structure that's a little bit different now versus back then. And how do we get back to like the similar profitability level at the similar revenue in the wrong rate back in the back, let's say, go back, only go back to a 30 years. Yeah. Yeah. I expected to be asked that question to us. So, and it's just something that we talk about internally. So, as I like to say to ourselves and to analysts and investors, in our business model, it's never one single dial. It's not like one thing we can focus on and we have to focus on two to four things to sort of move the needle in the right direction. In this regard, one of the things we need to get improvement on is gross margin. And that's primarily a result of mix which is going in our favor right now and also efficiencies on the line. So, I'm actually encouraged to be able to say this because it's pretty much in our control. And we've done better than we're doing right now. But this is common in manufacturing businesses to have some cycles. And so, I think we can work on that and focus on it and get improvement. That's probably the biggest one. I think we can get a bit more help from our joint venture companies. Expect that to improve in the quarters as well. But those are the two things that come to mind. So, Charles, maybe I can ask you to call the other question. I think that the deathliest thing in manufacturing, I think, analyst should ask is, is your ASP dropping? Okay. I think we can say, except with the low end on the two inch in the first line, most of our ASP are holding very firm. In fact, some of the ASP for our high end low EPE in the far side substrate, their ASP is increasing. So, I think we can surely stop that worry. I mean, we have some other efficiency issues such as loading factors, you know, germanium is perhaps not making a whole lot of money for us because the price in pressure is very strong. But, you know, the main focus on Indian fastway, the pricing is firm and the demand is high. Thanks. Well, I think maybe one last question before I jump back into the two, would be the Indian fastway demand you're seeing today, how much of that is from the overseas customers that would need a permit versus domestic Chinese customers. And if I recall correctly, I remember that the Indian fastway was primarily shifted to outside of China previously, how much of the domestic development today maybe has led to a little bit more of a domestic shipment of Indian fastway. If you can kind of, you know, paint a little bit of picture to also how things have been evolving, that would be great. Thank you. Well, you know, actually, Indian fastway business is very globally connected. A lot of our substrate are shipped to, let's say, Taiwan to put an EPE on and shipped back to the United States, put to make a device and shipped back to China to make a transceiver and then shipped back to U.S. data centers. So I think, you know, but our direct customer in China is roughly, I would say, 40%. But the great AI opportunity definitely is, you know, the big increase is the AI data center. In the United States. And I think I can add to that as well. If you look at our financials from Q2 versus Q3, you can see that the Indian phosphate in Q2 was about $3.5 million and that's increased to about $13 million in Q3. So that kind of gives you an idea of what the incremental is and all of that incremental has come from outside of China. Yeah. Thank you. Next question, please. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Shannon of Craig Allen. Please go ahead. Well, hi, Morris, Gary and Tim. Thanks for taking my questions and I'll offer grads on a wonderful quarter. Great to see. So I've graduated through the entire team for making that happen here. Let's start with the first question here in the Indian phosphate backlog. I just want to understand the dynamics here. Maybe if you can help us understand a few things here. What was the backlog a quarter ago? And then how far are our customers ordering here? I would imagine given one of the prior answers here talking about a permit, it allows you to ship for six months that they're probably going out six months here, but just want to get a sense of what this looks like and how it's changed. Yeah. So as Morris has previously said, those permits do last six months. But most of our customers are asking to ship as soon as we can. So that backlog, once we have a permit, we can ship that backlog as quickly as we can manufacture to be perfectly honest. So in terms of our backlog last quarter, we got more than double the backlog as we speak today than we had last quarter. So that continues to grow. And as was said in the conference call, we were seeing more and more new opportunities coming. So that backlog is growing daily as we speak. Yeah. You know, maybe I can chime in a bit. You know, I think the CEO, I take care of all of this China development, engineering, and electric manufacturing. And also my world, my duty is to push the IPO process in China. But recently, I got putting more and more to talk to investors, customers in the process. Because they cannot get enough material. They call myself guys. And the sales guy says, well, you got to come and visit the customers to calm them down. How are we opening up the opportunity to supply any phosphide customers? So I got a lot of these very good warm receptions from our customers. And sometimes the customers, customer, and also the end user. So in other words, the happy growers, the device makers, as well as the CPU, GPU makers. In fact, I got the message from our customers, especially globally, not especially. They all told us that we are a very important supplier of any phosphide. Secondly, they all told me there's a great, great opportunity to increase the demand in the near future. Obviously, they are all anxious to know what are we going to do to ease the pain of getting the permits to export material. And lastly, quite a few customer told us they start to appreciate the better EPD or the better quality of in the enforcement material we supply. In fact, when customer told me that now every diet counts and using our substrates, they can make better diet on their lasers or detectors. So I think that's a very warming information for me. And also telling us that in the phosphide, the paradigm shift because of the global increase demand for AI connectivity in optical transceivers. And what's the other word, CPLs? CPLs. I start to learn that more. Okay, that is helpful. I'm going to explore a couple of different angles on the dynamic here. So I think one of the things that investors will be worried about or cognizant of here is customers understanding the geopolitical dynamics as you referenced in your prepared remarks and worried about the door shutting here at any point, very well could be ordering well above what their normal rates of consumption would be and building some level of inventory. To what degree do you see that behavior anywhere here in the backlog build and what are the limits to your shipping faster? Are you near full utilization near the EPD today? So let me start by answering the dynamic question. I think the fact of the matter is that people are building inventory levels so that they have inventory on hand. But I don't think this is a one-time build-out because they're concerned. This is a multi-year cycle. So the demand today that we're seeing is real and you can see evidence of that all up and down the supply chain for optical transceivers. I want to really just look at some of the CAPEX spending messaging that was given from US hyperscalers on the early earnings calls yesterday. So everybody is talking about CAPEX moving faster and quote, growth in dollar is going to notice to be larger as we go through financial year 26. So there's definitely growth going on here at the hyperscaler level and we're seeing that come into here. We're also seeing longer term discussions on Indian Phosphi for CPO both on scale up and scale across now. So the demand is there, the demand is real. And of course people are building backlog. Also people are building inventory levels but those inventory levels will continue to grow. So we don't see this as a one and done shot. Yeah, so let me add on to another point. You know yesterday Tim and I were in the valley visiting a few actually customers customers. They're asking me what can they help in terms of financial aid, in terms of customer relationships to ensure that Indian Phosphi will be survived. In other words, they are telling me there's a tsunami coming. Okay, I just don't know how big the tsunami is because you know the normal rate, let's say if it is a one foot wave then tsunami is only 10 feet, it's not that big. But if the normal wave is already 5 feet then that's going to be very significant. So we're going to get that information soon but I think the demand from what I hear is enormous. And don't forget Richard, we are 40% of the Indian Phosphi supply chain and we have the best quality material. By the way, tsunami was used by the customer that Morris and Tim were visiting. We're not making it up in our conference room so that I was struck to hear that word as a description of what's on the future so. Okay, thanks for that. Now let me ask one another question here looking on the other side of this dynamic here which is you mentioned a number of engagements with customers you've not worked with ever or for a very long time here. I think Morris you've been talking about the very good EPD specs on your new Phosphi for a few years at least and we haven't heard you talk about new customers really much if at all. And I know I've asked on this conference called a few times in the last years on this topic. Why isn't there all of a sudden coming to you now? It seems like it's a unique or I guess a coincidental timing to seal a number of customers coming to you at this particular time. What's going on here and what's driving? Gee, you're so smart. I mean you called me but I tell you I have a perfect answer to that. That is first of all I think with all these lasers getting bigger and bigger the EPD is getting that much more because the larger the device the chances of you hitting a EPD is higher. In fact yesterday I was told by one of the customers how come you guys can make the EPD so low? Right Kim? Right and I think the market is maturing such as well and the demands that our customers are being faced with increased demands, increased capacity. One of the customers said to us every device is important. The yield of devices on a wafer has become so much more important today than it ever has been both because of cost and capacity constraints within the fad. So people are turning to us because they get much higher device yields from our wafers. Yes that's that customer told us. Straight in the face they wouldn't tell us because we would have to ask higher price. Richard a secondary factor subservient to what Morris and Tim just described is there is a concern among the customer base about capacity and capacity potential. They're sensing that they're shortages and we are the best positioned currently with capacity and with the ability to respond quickly to add capacity. Well Gary that was a perfect setup for my next question here which is on a full run rate basis hand-in-mouth basis here what is your kind of maximum Indian flash fiber revenues per quarter here and how long how long would it take you to get in new capacity and what kind of CAPEX commitment to grow at five I don't know say 25 percent how does that look like? Well you know we could double our capacity on Indian flash fly in about nine months time. It would take us about my estimation is because this is our green field we got the green room already we got your land already and all we need to do is add a few crystal boys so my estimation is about 10 to 15 million dollars but we need a signal I'm getting it. So let me answer the question on current capacity there Richard so it's a complex question because it depends on a number of factors relating to product mix and weight-to-size inventory on hands and all that kind of stuff but we estimate that current capacity is around about 20 million dollars a quarter for Indian phosphide with our current with our current run rate and current capacity that we've got. You asked how quickly can we increase by 25 percent probably within within about three months we can increase by 25 percent we do not need to build anything other than bring some more furnaces online. And to add for us to double that then we need a nine month. That's that's perfect perspective. I've asked a lot of questions I will jump the line and read to you here guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Tinshaversville north on capital markets. Please go ahead. Hey good afternoon and again we got some that backlog number believe it or not I still have a few questions and I guess the the overall question is guys is doubling capacity is that a tsunami or is that just good business? That's a good question but I think I'll be happily retiring when the capacity is doubled with all these very gross money. I'm joking. I think it's a lot more than that. I think but one step at the time I think if we can double that and I think we have all the ability to increase our capacity well the easiest way is in China but I think beyond that we may want to consider building something. Yeah U.S.-based capacity would make a lot of sense and yeah I think just intuitively a tsunami like 5 to 10x and you know I have heard numbers like that in the industry in terms of where demand is going to be and it sounds like the tsunami reference in particular is that a specific kind of looking forward scale up scale across comments which is to say I assume what you're seeing in terms of current demand is likely module driven might be some early CPO you tell me but in terms of the real big step function and capacity is that discussion mostly CPO based or scale up type based? Yeah that's absolutely right. So we are seeing growth right now that is we believe in the pluggable market and probably will continue to be in the pluggable market for the next few years but we are starting to have those discussions now about growth rates for CPO for scale up and the tsunami the 5 10x that you talk about that that is a lot of that is coming from CPO for scale up. Yeah yeah it makes sense. Sorry Morris you're saying something? No I say yes. Yeah I like the question I'll add to the just trying to get a sense of this backlog. So you know you increased your backlog you doubled it and shipped 13 million in material which I think gives you a book to build it's approaching three so that's not bad but where would that kind of normally be I guess and so maybe as opposed to go back to last quarter let's go back to last year or just historically you know without export you know permits required what kind of backlog would you normally have in terms of you know quarters of revenue or or just straight up where was that any classified backlog you know Q3 24? Well because we could be responsive to customer orders we had a lot of terms business every quarter so so to be honest we don't really in terms of me and Morris and Tim we don't manage the company by looking at a book to build you know I have in other companies but it's not very meaningful in this case but so it's hard to say what it was because I don't have a piece of paper in front of me with that list because there there's no such list. Got it well it sounds like it should be some fraction you know maybe half or third or whatever you're in the classified revenue was a year ago yeah and your backlog is tsunami it's up 10x right yeah and again tsunami was not I agree with you tsunamis 5 to 10x and I'll say again that was not our words that was the words from you know an in customer so yeah okay a lot last one for me mentioned two 10 customers in the quarter and Morris you talked about kind of industry structure you know FD tier one back to the US but any color on you know whether you've got a you know an integrated device maker in there it's just really focused on happy way for suppliers or whether you might have a new 10% customer in there Tim yeah with so the 10% customers that we've got we've been dealing with for a while the new customers that we've got are our integrators as well we're dealing more and more with with integrators and hard hardware customers including GPU and CPU makers exactly right so we're dealing with directly with GPU CPU hardware makers we're dealing with pluggable makers so we're having more that's where really the visibility is coming from yeah I would say in the past we haven't we haven't had access to those people but now they they're calling us they want to see us so that's why we had better visibility so got it thanks your next question comes from the line of math pricing of web bush securities please go ahead and this is gonna sound a little bit like some play but it's not a complaint um just curious so there's clearly a whole lot of demand out there your job becomes uh competitor is is announced to give out the increases in the last I think four months three months um just curious if you're have all this backlog and your customers want more product faster why wouldn't you be building in shipping to capacity next quarter or this quarter well um all of our all of our shipments all of all of our ability to ship is based on permitting so um we as we've talked about plenty of times we've got a large backlog now we can ship as we've been told by customers we can ship as quickly as we possibly can but we have to go through the permitting process now that permitting process you know it takes 60 business days which is approximately three months um and there there is some opaqueness to that permitting process so um you know if we if we had a bunch of permits today I'm sure we could ship an awful lot more of that backlog today um you know we've we've guided at 27 to 30 million dollars if we've permits could we ship more than that yes we could but we're we're we're basically running trend analysis on how long it takes to get permits and uh probability analysis of what permits we're going to get um and that that's where the guidance comes in by the way we're not standing still are those orders that we are applying for permits we're putting that into whip in other words we're making it and we're packaging and waiting for the permits to to be issued and then we can deliver right away got it understood so it I mean it comes down to the promise of the getting factor but as hopefully permit approvals continue to get across the line and lift there's a path to you know achieving the the levels of shipments that you were at a few few years back during covid um and then I guess what's in terms of gross margins obviously when you're running back at a close full capacity back then you had substantially higher gross margins I guess what's what's key to getting gross margins back up is it predominantly utilization or were you benefiting back then from higher pricing um can you just talk to kind of the dynamics around gross margins where they can go to from here if you can get in the emphosphide backup to full utilization yeah um pricing is not really the big factor I think the the big factor is is volume because it does carry more of the fixed assets um in a proper way and um and then it's it I'm confident we can return you know we're going to be over 30 percent because there's we can control that so we need we you know we need to improve the efficiencies on the line but I already commented on that so um I see it going in that direction I think the most important factor is we got more we can utilize our in-device right line I think that's the greatest opportunity we we're facing now got it understood more thanks thanks man next question once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question ask the star button followed by the number one on your telephone keypad there are no further questions at
