For years, SSAB has focused on high-strength steals, world-class products, as well as profitable market segments, delivering unique value to our customers. We now have a strong market position and solid financials for the next phase, accelerating premium leadership with a focus on advanced steel grades, value-add services and solutions, and decarbonized steals. Our investments will increase the capacity of our most profitable products. This will create value for all stakeholders. Join us when we're transforming the future of steel. Good morning and welcome to SSAB's capital market stay 2025. Very big welcome to all of you joining us here this morning in Oxaloosund. And a big welcome to those joining us over web cost. We're sorry about the small delay and getting started. Combination of buses, traffic and rain created a small delay. But now we're here and we're ready to start. My name is Helena Norman. I'm head of communications for SSAB and I'm very happy to be here today together with my colleagues to talk you through the coming five years and beyond of SSAB strategy and execution. It's also fantastic to be here in Oxaloosund today. It's been an important part of Swedish steelmaking history for more than a century. And now we're ready to take the next step with a moving from old technology to new technology that will happen soon and more about that during the day. Before we go into today's program, I would like to welcome Corinne Pankfist on stage. Corinne is site manager and head of production here in Oxaloosund. And she will talk us a little bit more about where we are and very importantly safety instructions for the day. Yes, thank you Helena. So my name is Corinne Pankfist. I am the site manager of Oxaloosund and I would like to welcome you all again to Oxaloosund and SSAB. I will briefly instruct you of the safety. But first, just some words on where we are. You enter the area and we're now in the like the northern part of the site. And this is the part where we are like making the finishing of our plate products in Oxaloosund. In this building, we are storing semi-finished plates before quenching and finalizing. But the recent and newest equipment that we have is just nearby us here. It's a new production line where we are joining plates together by welding and then having them quenched to get the same properties as non-welded plates. So this is an own patent production process that we're very proud of and it's really new and we're happy to have you in this building then. So the safety is really important to us at SSAB and I would like you to pay attention now because I would point out the emergency exits and the assembly point. If there will be like an emergency and you will have to leave the building, you enter the doors or the gates where you came from. There are gates in the back of this building. The assembly point is just by the blue containers. You saw the nice containers framing this area. So that's the assembly point. There will be first aid and defibrillator in the back of this room by the SSAB staff. We'll call our own fiber gate to make sure that we get assistance as necessary. So again, very welcome to you all to Oxalo Zoned. Thank you, Corinne. A few more practical details for those of you, especially in the room before we continue into the program. First of all, toilets are located out from the entrance you came in through on the left. It's a white mobile container. On the note of safety, when you exit, it's a rather steep step down. So be careful so you don't trip and fall. Smoking is only allowed on the left-hand side of the blue containers outside. Photography allowed in this building, in the building where we will have dinner. There are two cell fistbots on the tour this afternoon, apart from that, except for photographers with special permit that will get special instructions, photography is not permitted. We'll come to how we do the Q&A's later. We have an agenda for the day. Maybe I can actually show it here. So we have an agenda that will start from an overview of strategy and market by our CO. Then we will go through the different divisions and subsidiaries. It's a deep dive. We will have a coffee break. There will be a few Q&A's. We will have lunch a little bit later than 12, because this was assuming that the buses would have arrived a little bit earlier, so around 12.20 maybe. And then we will come together again after lunch, CTO, CFO, final Q&A, and final remarks by John Equestrum. And that will take us up to around 2 p.m. Stockholm time or Swedish time. And then there will be a continued programme for those of you that are here on site, but we'll come back to that later. So let's continue into the programme and introduce today's first speaker, John Equestrum, long experience in the industry. Associate Professor in Material Science. He joined SSABI in 2019 and has been running our Special Steel Division until taking up the role as President and CEO almost exactly a year ago. John E, welcome to the stage is yours. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to SSABI's Captain Marcus Day. And also welcome to the student. Before I get started with my presentation, I just want to just emphasize what Corin was saying, that the investment we have here to the right is one of its kind and it's a patent technology that we have. It's also, I think it's a breakthrough when it comes to joining place together and then doing the quenching. We're the only one in the world that does it. And in the exhibition centre, you will be able to see the result. And you're going to be amazed that you can actually, you cannot see the world at all, not in the cross section, but not on the top either. So it's a very unique solution. All right. So my name is John Equestrum, I'm the President and CEO of SSABI. What you see on this picture here is the world largest optical telescope. Scientists say that it takes around eight minutes for the light to go from the sun to the planet Earth. With this telescope, we can detect light that's been traveling for 13 billion years. And they say that the Big Bang theory or the Big Bang happened 13.8 billion years ago. So with this telescope, you can see stars being born, you can also see black holes, you can also detect new stars and galaxies far away. This telescope is in Chile, but it's owned by the European Southern Observatory. And it's rather big. You see the size of these cars that gives you an idea of how big this is. And the total weight of the tower is 3,700 tons. And you can actually turn it in order to follow the stars that you want to have a look at. When they were designing this telescope, they had a problem finding the gear tracks or the gear racks to move the whole telescope because of the forces that you put on the gear tracks. And the only material that they could approve for this application was an SSABI material called 2Lox. This is a very typical example of applications that we tell to that no one knows about. We are quite often disillusioned when no one else has the solution. When they need material for really extreme applications, we are the ones that come up with the solution. Because we have a unique production method of combining hardness and toughness. This, of course, have taken a lot of years. It didn't happen overnight. Our journey started, I guess, already in the 1970s when there was a crisis here in Europe. There was a shipyard called Kocum that went bankrupt. That was the number one customer for the Oxford Sun site at that time. And Oxford Sun had to do something different. So they decided to invest in a quenching line. That was the first quenching line within SSABI. Of course, it took a lot of years until they grew that market. But that indicated, and it was a milestone for this technology. And then after that, in the year 2000 and further on, the internalization started, gave us additional diversification. Ipsko was acquired around 2008. And then later, there was a merger with Rautaruki. And also a lot of downstream activities started. In 2015 and beyond, we started this specialization. And one example of this is the Dokkul 1700. The Dokkul is a unique grade. It offers a lot of safety to the market. And I will give you examples later on in this presentation, what it's used for. And of course, the commercialization of the SSABI Sero product also started. So what do we have ahead of us? I think that we have a good platform to stand on when it comes to diversification. But in a world of overcapacity, the only way to be successful is by being unique and create unique customer value. So our idea is that we're going to continue to accelerate our premium leadership that we already have on the market. And we have a very, very good platform to stand on. So this is showing sort of the market position for some of our divisions. And if you start with SSABI Special Steel, who's only working with premium steel grades, 100% of what they produced is advanced high strength steel or premium grades. There is a technique called quenching and tempering. And that's what Q&T stands for. And in this case, it shows that we have roughly a global market share of 30%. But if you take a closer look, I would say that we have roughly 50% market share in North America. We have 50% market share in South America, almost about 50% market share in Europe. It's when we look at the whole world and include China into this, where the number goes down to 30%. But we have a very unique market position. And we are the preferred supplier when it comes to special steel grades and quenching and tempering. If you look at SSABI Americas, we have been ranked as a number one supplier for many, many years. And we have surveys that shows this. Number one, when it comes to quality, number one, when it comes to delivery performance and reliable partner. And if you look at the SSABI Europe, who quite often is linked to stand-up products, which is wrong, for the last 10 years, they have been working really hard to position themselves as also a unique supplier of advanced high strength steel. And Tony will show that in his presentation, they will also show that further on in my slides. And to support SSABI Europe with their sales, they also have rookie construction in Timnore to sell as an outlet of their products. And when I visited the Global Steel Forum in New York a couple of months ago, all companies there, and Postco was there, all global companies were there, and they were all saying, we're going to go downstream. Because they are struggling to make money. And so what is your strategy now? We're going to go downstream. We're going to do a lot more value added. We have already done that journey. We acquired Timnore and we have rookie construction. We had that for a long period of time. And on top of this, we have Albrez service and other outlets. But with this, it gives us diversification both geographically to 58% of what we produce and sell is in Europe. But we also have a significant footprint in the United States. And then we also tell percent of our material being exported. We sell roughly 55% as premium products. And I will define later on in this presentation what we mean by premium. And we have a very strong financial position. We have a net cash position of roughly $8.11 billion as we just shown them. If you look at our historical financial performance, we can see that we have an average, been earning 14% EBITDA over a business cycle. And if we compare that to our European peers, we have been outperforming them. Now, we have to remember that the market situation for many years in Europe has been a little bit odd, a little bit strange. Because the market has been able to buy extremely cheap material coming from Asia, from China. Material that has been subsidized, not even covering the cost of the variable cost, the raw material. And that is not sustainable. It's not realistic to think that this will continue. And we already see movements in this direction. But even during the time period where we have been struggling with cheap imports, we have been able to make 14% in average. And if who has been benefiting from the Section 232 that was implemented in 2018, we are pretty much on the same level. So, under these circumstances, I would say it hasn't been a bad performance. So, and what do we do with the earnings? Well, we are committed to our financial targets, and that is to have a 40% dividend of our net profit. That is something we have been doing. And the majority of our capital has been allocated to the shareholders in the shape of dividends. And of course, we always do maintenance cup picks. But historically, and Leanna was showed that in her presentation, we haven't done that much strategic investments. But that needs to be changed now. We see an opportunity for us to reposition on the market, to grab a stronger position on the market. And hence, we have a more aggressive strategic investment program ahead of us. And I look at the total return the last five years. It is roughly 200% that is including also the share price increase. So, what I said in the beginning that we are going to strive for more premium, and that is because we want to have less volatility. We want to be able to price a good example of that it actually works. Especially, it has only advanced high strength deals in its portfolio. Hence, they are not sensitive to market conditions and market variations, and they continue to supply a unique customer value to the market. And their earnings has been continuously growing up. If you compare that to, as I say, the Americas, you see a higher volatility. As I say, the Americas has a very unique position in cost of cost leadership, and they are also a quality leader. But the portion of advanced high strength deal is quite limited. Hence, they are still sensitive to market changes. However, they have a very unique position on the USA plate market. Now with the tariffs, and looking at the competition, and track will present that in its presentation, we have a very unique position. And then, if you look at the Xavier Europe, even though they have been performing better than their have increased their amount of advanced high strength deal, they are still a little bit sensitive to the spot market prices for high share of their portfolio. The idea is that we're going to walk away from that and be less dependent on the spot prices. So, a lot of the investments that we're planning to do is going to be within the Xavier Europe, which makes a sense that we're going to be able to reposition the Xavier Europe to more of a premium supplier. And then, of course, we have the two outlets. Theoretic and Sami will tell more about that in their presentations. But this is important for us, and a lot of our competitors are yellows that we already have these outlets, and they supply a lot of added value to the market, and they have a very good market position. We believe that the construction segment is going to come back, and when it does, we have a very good footprint, and we're going to be able to increase our earnings in these areas. Roughly 400,000 tons of Xavier Europe's material is going through Tibnor, and 130,000 to 150,000 tons of Xavier Europe's material is going through Rooki construction. We also have a very, very good operational platform to stand on. For years, we've been working on production stability. We have been working on continuous improvements. We have a very good program on this. We have a very high capacity utilization, and Chuck is going to give you one example of that in his presentation, and we have also increased our delivery performance. But one example that I want to show you, which is the proof of our operational excellence, is the improvement we've done in safety, and this is indicating the lost time in the frequency that continues to go down. It improves the safety of our workers, but it also indicates that we have good control of our production. So the market conditions are changing. We see that there's a bigger demand for advanced high strength deals, and that is coming from a lot of different segments. And this is an area where we already now have a very good footprint. We are one of the largest advanced high strength suppliers in the world, and we have the competence and the knowledge how to do it. The global seed industry is suffering from an overcapacity mainly coming from Asia, and specifically China. An industry that has been subsidized for years. This is, of course, changing the landscape and the competitive landscape, and we've already seen the tariffs being implemented in the United States. And now we already see that the European Commission is suggesting safeguards to save the European steel industry. And in my opinion, it's likely that we will see those safeguards being implemented sometime in the beginning of next year, or sometimes in the spring next year. And that will completely change the landscape in Europe. But it's also necessary to save the European steel industry from cheap imports. A lot of stakeholders in Europe are struggling now financially, and we need to do something in order to save them. I think one of the things that we should remind ourselves is that we are still focusing on fit for 55 in the European Union. We still have the ETS system. Sometimes I think we tend to forget about that. And in the condition where most of our competitors are putting their investments on hold, we continue. The demand for low emission steel is still there. I think that we will have a perfect opportunity when our investments are up and running. And we can supply low emission steel to the market. Because we're going to be one of the few that can actually do it. And we also, around the corner, we have the CBAM starting in 2026. We already see now that we have European customers securing supply from Europe. Because a lot of the companies exporting into Europe have a hard time to do demonstration, to file the permit, to export into Europe now with the CBAM. It's also CBAM is going to come at the cost, of course. We monitor this, of course, and it's clear indications that the demand for advanced high-strain steel is increasing. And like I said in the beginning, we are a perfect position for this. This market is quite limited as it is, but we have a very unique position in it. The automotive industry is moving towards more lighter vehicles, especially electric vehicles. And here we can offer extremely good solutions, not only offering safety, but also more lighter cars. But we can also see that happening in other transport, heavy transport. We can see that in buildings, skyscrapers that become taller, they need advanced high-strain steel mechanical equipments. So this is something we have identified, and this is going to happen. I touched upon this before, but we already know that Section 232 was implemented in 2018, and that helped the American market. And since then we have seen new investments in the United States. We also saw that Chinese material found new ways of entering the United States through Vietnam and other countries. And then now in 2025 they have said that we're going to put a blanket of 50% of all imported material that has helped our position in the United States. And it's going to continue to support us and our position in the United States. Now we see that a similar thing is going to happen in the European Union. It's likely that this is going to be approved by the European Union. That means that we're going to have a quotation system, and this is also okay according to the World Trade Organization. So there's almost 18 million tons of flat products that will be subjected to 50% tariff, and it's more likely that this supply is going to come from European companies than outside Europe. This is going to change the landscape in Europe. So in 2026 it's going to be a very interesting year for many, many reasons. So what do we mean by premium? We believe that anything that we can be paid an extra money for is a premium, but we have categorized this into three categories. One category is the advanced steel grace that we can offer to the market. And here we have a unique position. This is also including the color-coated, the metal-coated, but also the laser-plus material as well as the advanced high strength steel grades. But we also believe that we can provide premium to the market a unique customer value by doing value-added operations. And in the exhibition booth you will be able to see a lot of the value added we already do to the market today. And I think that the first stage you will get to, you will see a 3D-printed hood. It's a miniature of what we actually do. Today we actually weld together, you will cover this in your presentation. But we already do pre-assembly for the military industry, helping them out when they have a lack of capacity. And this is mainly for welding. And we're also able to supply the carbonized steel to the market, which is also very important for us, but that's the support of our premium. I just want to highlight because I am a sort of a material scientist nerd. I really like microstructure and things like that that no one else likes. And I also like to be a part of the development of new grades. I think that this Horlex High-Ace is a very unique combination of wear resistance as well as corrosion resistance. Horlex is known for the wear resistance, but with the High-Ace we're also able to offer some corrosion resistance. And this is extremely important when we have extremely aggressive environments like in the pulp and paper industry, where we can combine in the pulp and paper industry there's a lot of sulfuric acid. And if you have only a wear resistant material, the corrosion will wear it down anyway. But if you combine wear resistance, the corrosion resistance, you've increased the service life considerably. And now for the doccal grade that I spoke about before, this is a 1700 megapascal. It offers protection in cars in the side collision beams. It's really attractive and we still export a lot of this into the United States because they can't find any local supply. It also makes the car lighter. We're actually able to offer a better solution than aluminum, but at 50% of the cost. When it goes to protective steel, we have seen now from the war in Ukraine that you can't have heavy tanks. You have to have much lighter tanks. And in order to have lighter tanks, it means you need to have more advanced steel. We have a very advanced steel for protection. It's called armocks. And if you use our steel-grade armocks, you can actually reduce the weight into protection by 50%. And this is a market of course, which is growing. And I think that we have a perfect position to capitalize on that. When it goes to value added, we try to look at what is it the customer needs and how can we help the customer? And how can we complement the markets? So laser tool is a company that we acquired that does laser hardening. And the telescope you see is so in the beginning, that surface has actually been laser hardened. We also acquired a company called Period Steel. Samuel will tell more about that in his presentation. But we also offer a lot of safety solutions for roofing. Tenor is as a clear strategy to go for more processing. There used to be a clear distribution center, but now it's more of a processing center to add more value to the market and the customer. And last but not least, we believe that we have a perfect position to add 3D printing into the market. Our objective is to sell the powder for 3D printing, but also bring the technology into the market. It's developing slowly, but we understand that. That's usually the case with new technology. But we're very certain that this is going to grow. And we have a perfect position for this. I think we're the only company in the world that offers advanced science steel powder to the market. And then we shouldn't forget about this. We still have a lot of customers. And this summer I went to see a lot of automotive industry customers. And they still confirm that they need this and they're willing to pay a premium for it. I don't think that everything that we can produce using the electric arc furnace can be sold as a premium, but I do believe that there is a part of that we can sell as a premium. So when we sell advanced science steel, we're able to get much higher profits. So it's a clear indication. It's very, very clear from our sales experience. So the idea is that we could continue to grow, you know, the value, the more advanced science steel to the market that gives us more earnings. And that's a clear part of our strategy. Same thing when it comes to the value added. We can also see that when we sell it as a value added, we earn a lot more from it. This is also why PostCo and other companies are going in this direction. And I would touch upon that before, but according to our business forecast, we only think that it's around 15% of what we're going to sell that we might get a sort of a zero premium on it or a low emission steel premium on it. And what we see now is the indication is two to three hundred euros per ton. But like I said, we estimate it's going to be 15% now, but we have the ability to grow this business if you need to and if the market wants to. So this is also showing what we're going to do. And even in special steels, they were going to continue to go more for the niche products they have on the top of this pyramid. And we're going to go for more of solutions when it comes to value added. And then, of course, we have the option to sell more of this for some free steel to the market if the customer wants it. But they have the option to choose what they want. So the target we have is to reach 55% premium in 2024. We already have done that. And then to reach 65% to 2030. We have to remember now that the large investment we're doing, especially the one in Ludio, is going to add more capacity when it comes to premium production. That will not be online online until end of 2009. And it's going to take some ramp up time. So it's not realistic to believe that this is going to be higher than 65%. But then we have higher ambitions going from 2030 to reach 75%. To support our strategy, to support our sort of advanced, our premium strategy, we have an aggressive investment program. You all know about this Ludio investment program. And in this case, the Ludio case has been split into three parts. This is the Ludio cold milk complex. This is actually where we're going to get more capacity for the metal coating. We're going to be able to provide a metal coating that only one other competitor can do on the market. But we're also going to be able to do the docco in higher volumes that we can today. It's going to be an additional capacity for it. And this is a key for our success going forward. We're also going to replace the sort of outdated old old strip mill in boiling it with one in Ludio. And that's going to lead to higher efficiency and lower fixed cost. And then of course, we're going to move away from the blast furnace than using electric arc furnaces. And this transformation is being done. Both nooks are still in this well as in Ludio. And then we're also planning. And some of this hasn't been approved as someone has. But we're planning to grow the quencent temper market, the area that Paris is responsible for. Because that's where we see the biggest earnings, and also where we see the biggest potential. Our Nordic transformation is continuing according to our plan. And we still believe that the frame of 4.5 billion for the millimeter Ludio is still valid. Call, we'll cover more about that in his presentation. And we also, we are in line when it comes to the electric arc furnace investment in inoxiles soon. And you will be able to see parts of it today. And you get more information on that. And then when it comes to raw, I think that initially it was communicated that we were going to build a mini-mill. We have decided it's not going to be a mini-mill in raw. It doesn't make any sense. Raw is going to be a site where we're going to have more flexibility. I think it's extremely important that we have a large production site that doesn't have continuous production. We need to be able to cool down the slabs and then reheat them when you have pre-rotected grades or when you have grades who are sensitive to hydrogen, et cetera. That flexibility will be built up in raw. And I think that's extremely important. So the plan is it's going to be an electric arc furnace, but it's going to be a similar type as we have here inoxiles zone. That means we're going to add it into the existing production. It's going to be a much more cost efficient solution. But most importantly for me, it's going to give us a more flexible solution and a good complement to the Ludio minimal. I think for me, this slide is quite important. This is an illustration of what we want to do. And on the y-axis, you have the ABTA per tone. And then on the x-axis, you have the premium share. And you can see that we're all planning to move in a direction to increase our premium share. I think the biggest movement is going to be in, as I say, Europe, because that's where we are a little bit more sensitive when it comes to market prices and spot prices. But the idea is that the, as I say, the Europe is going to reposition themselves to become a more of a premium supplier. We also have the idea that we could continue to upgrade the portfolio we have within Special Steel. And I'll probably talk more about that. But we have for natural reasons seen how defense industry is growing. We've also seen that the grades that's 500 tough is growing in demand. And we're going to capitalize on that. And then we, of course, we have the United States. We're going to try to capitalize on our, first of all, our unique market position when it's called the cost leader, but the limited competition in the United States, as well as working more with value added going forward. And Chuck will explain more about that in his presentation. Then to summarize, I think that a lot of analysts, a lot of customers, already today, see us as a world leading steel company. We already today have the most advanced degrees in the world. We offer unique solutions when there are no other options on the market. This is something we're going to capitalize on. We see also that the market trends are moving in our direction, in our favor. Not only is there a bigger demand for advanced high strength steel, but we also see that when others are posing their green initiatives, we continue with this. That gives us an opportunity. We're not dependent on it, but we have the opportunity to capitalize on it when we get to that point. And it's very, very clear that in a world of overcapacity, to go for premium and unique customer value proposition is really the right way to go. And that's really what we're going to target. And we have the investment program to support. I think with that, I think that was my last slide, Helena. Yes, thank you, Johnny. So before we move forward, let's take a little pause and see if we have any questions from the audience. And then the instruction for asking questions is, if you want to ask a question, raise your hand. The microphone will come your way. Introduce yourself. We also have the web calls. So we want to make sure everyone understands what's happening here. So let's see, do we have any initial questions? Yes, let's start. Microphone coming here. Yes, hi. It's Tristan Gresser from BNP by Bikes. And just maybe one question to start off with the Rower investment you decided against to do a mini-mill. Can you explain the rationale behind it? And in terms of CapEx, if it's closer to what you spent at Uxilosun, which was $6 billion, is that a good reference point? And also, lastly, you said that the CapEx will not overlay. So in the presentation today, you shared some insights. So that doesn't mean that we shouldn't see CapEx from Rower until 2021 at the earliest. So the core of SSAB is the knowledge on how to produce real advanced high strength steel. When you produce it with continuous production, you don't go through phase transformations. You should stay at austenitic phase. That means you have limited abilities when it comes to controlling grain growth. You have limitations in regards to handling peritectic steel grains. And you have also limitation when it comes to handling the hydrogen, which could be very embrittleing to the material. That means that we need to find a new way to produce that. And that needs to be in raw. So the rationale behind it is that we're going to be standardizing and producing more volumes in Lulu, more batch production, volume production with efficiency. But the grades who needs to produce in a more advanced way will be done in raw, because we need to have a slab cool down and then reheat it again. And we might also be forcing the diffusion in the E-Link before we start the production. So that's the rationale behind it. We need that flexibility. So clearly our strategy is to be a more of a premium supplier. The Lulu minimal will do some of that. But for the advanced real advanced E-grids that will be in a sort of a coil format needs to be handled in raw through not a continuous production. So that's a sort of rationale. It's strictly related to the portfolio that we want to produce in the future. I hope that answers your question. And then your second question was related to the size of the... The CapEx investment. The CapEx investment. And it's clearly going to be much cheaper than the minimum. I can assure you that. But it's going to be a larger investment than the one that looks as soon, because the Sun furnace is slightly smaller than the one that we're going to invest in in ROI. So we're going to have two electric arc furnaces as well. Give us an additional flexibility as well. Well, you're still going to plan to build electric arc furnaces at the value. Sorry, come here. You're still going to build new electric arc furnaces at the value. In ROI, that's our plan. Yes, it is. But the timing is another question. We need to make sure that we feel comfortable with the raw material supply. So not until we have a raw material supply that we feel comfortable with. Because we are in a situation now that in the beginning, we're going to have scrap production in Sweden, both in Oxisund and also in Luleo. And then we're going to have iron ore production in Finland. That gives us a very unique flexibility. We can supply pig iron from the raw material into Luleo if you want to. We can take virgin scrap from our mill in ROI into Sweden. That gives us a flexibility that we can control within SSAB. I think that's extremely important. Of course, in the long run, we have ideas. We plan to get DRI from LKA. We, of course, we plan for it. But in the beginning, it's only going to be 1.3 million tons. So that means that we need additional virgin material. And if we're going to convert ROI, then we need security that we have a virgin material source to supply them. So for me, right now, when you talk about risk, I feel very comfortable with having iron ore production in Finland and scrap production in Sweden, giving me a full flexibility on how I want to do the production. More questions, yes. Let's go microphone in the middle here. My lad. Thank you. Tom Zhang from Barclays. Maybe just following up on your point about pricing premium and your assumptions there. So you said maybe not all the product that you can produce from any AF you can get a premium from. But then you still talk to two to three hundred euros a ton from the SSAV zero product. You talk us a little bit about the gap between those two because I guess from a carbon footprint perspective, maybe not a massive difference between them. Do you really think two to three hundred euros is still possible? Let's say in 2030 is once a meaningful amount of production is also through EAF. So as of right now, the Eurofarer is agreeing on a definition for the low emission steel. And it's very likely that we're going to follow the less policy. So it's going to be graded. So based on the CO2 emissions, of course. So if the customer wants to have zero percent CO2 emissions, we're going to be able to offer that. But if they want it, it comes with a premium because our cost will be higher, hence they will need to pay more. To your questions, do we have a demand for this? And the answer is yes. When we speak to a lot of automotive companies, they are more concerned. They're not going to get the availability. And they want to secure their volumes with us already now. And they're willing to pay this. And these are quite often premium suppliers. They are the ones that are telling us that they are willing to pay two to three hundred euros per ton. But in our business plan for the low to minimum, we have used extremely conservative figures. Because this is a very high uncertainty. We don't know what the future is going to be like. We don't know what the market driver is going to be around the corner. But what we can tell you that today there is a demand, especially for the automotive industry. And today, we know for certain that we can get two to three hundred euros per tonne for it. Then the question is, what's going to happen 2033? It's really hard to say. It's hard to predict. And that's why we have been very conservative all along. That's also the reason why we only set 15% of what we produce. We believe they're going to get the premium from. Even though there's going to be a lot of electric arc furnace production. Let's do one more question. And then we'll move on in the programme. And Joni will be back for more questions later. Thanks, Jani. This is Alan Gabriel from Morgan Stanley. Your strategy appears to be much more focused on the downstream where you see the biggest opportunity for margin expansion. What about the upstream? You seem to be migrating away from the upstream. And this is a key competitive advantage in securing your green feedstock. Is there room in your strategy for the upstream investments? And do you not worry that there's going to be value leakage through the cycle to the upstream green pick iron, for example? So it's a relevant question. We have partnered up with LKB. And the idea is that this DRI, hydrogen reduced DRI, is going to be produced by LKB. And that's still valid. I know that there's been a lot of articles in the papers, etc. But we have a close communication with LKB. And I can confirm that they are strict on their plans to produce this DRI facility. I think that's a good starting point. Of course, we already all the time evaluate what our position is going to be when it comes to iron production, pure iron production. And of course, that's an assessment we're doing all the time. And we're also assessing the risk. But it's not a part of our packets that we are announcing now. I think what's important is our premium story. And like I said in the beginning, in the world of overcapacity, when you can buy steel at lower than variable costs, the only way to make money is by going for premium. And we have the best platform in the world to actually do that. And the demand is there. And of course, we want to capitalize on it. That's what we want to do. But we haven't left this hybrid technology for sure. That's still part of our strategy. But we have nothing to announce on it at this point. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much for those questions. Thank you, Tony, for the presentation. You will be back later on in the program. But it's time to move over and take a closer look at the divisions and subsidiaries. And our first speaker is Perel Fkrien, head of SSAB Special Steel. Pere has been with the company since 1996 in this role for about a year, because you were previously responsible for market development and stepped up to this role when Joni moved up to the CEO role. So welcome, Pere, the state's yours. Thank you very much. So special steels. That's a truly global business. We operate two sites, one in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Oxalozo and Sweden, where you are right now. So very much welcome here. We have a global presence with our sales, and we supply more than 15,000 customers. And they represent a wide variety of different segments. So whenever someone needs a strong light or durable solutions, we are there to support and also to deliver. And with this, we're built actually quite solely, or very solely, the resilient business model. That is based on 100% premium high strength steels, local presence, and our own distribution. So now for the next 20 minutes, I will take you through how we got to the position that we have today, and how we intend to work in order to stay in the lead. It all starts with high quality products. Hard dogs are where steel. I would argue it's the most well-known brand in the steel industry. It is hard, tough, and you use it when you want to increase payload or uptime. Strength or structural steel. We say it fights gravity because you use it when you want to build something light and strong, for instance, to extend the reach of a crane or make a trailer a lot lighter. Armocks protects people and property. We supply it both to civil and military equipment. It's bullet and blasting proof, and it's really good to have if they go and get stuff. Two logs. Our pre-hardened tool steel is used when failure is not an option. In applications like plastic molding, dyes, and machine components. And then we have the powder that you want to touch on as well. Centended for 3D printing, and it's going to be a product that we supply. You can actually 3D print parts in our excellent steel qualities. So then the question is, what kind of value does these products deliver to our customers and end-users? And I have a couple of examples here. Up to the left, you see a trailer. It's a trailer that was originally produced in high-strength 700 material and a truck box in Hardox 450. So already there, an upgraded application. A good solution, I would say. But there was more to do to this solution. So by increasing the strength in the trailer from 700 to 960, and going from a 450 wear material in the box to 500 tough, you can see that the customer saved another 300 kilos on this vehicle. By changing the solution, also the service life was extended to the double. And over the lifetime, this vehicle will save around 5 cubic meters of fuel for the end-user. So that's good value for money. Example number two is the Hardox High-Eyes. It's the wear-resistant steel combined with corrosion resistance. In this case, in this container, it was originally in a stainless steel material. Now with Hardox High-Eyes, the payload increased with 1.1 ton, which is a lot in equipment like this. It was also cheaper to produce because we could remove a lot of welding, putting these books together. And you can see that the service life was almost tripled. So that's really good value for money, that as well. These things we do together with our customers. So it's our experts together with their designers, coming together, working around these solutions to come up with this, and save money. And they know that they will save money, and we know that they will save money, and that's something that we can also get paid for when we do this. So talking about value and good values, another thing good value is to stay on the safe side. And that's actually what you do if you use our protection steel armocks. It comes in a very, very wide variety of different grades and thicknesses. So no matter if there is a challenge within a civil or military application, we are there to support. And you can see a few examples up here. You have the train. It's actually a train moving from Mozambique to South Africa that needs bullet protection to protect the engine, and also the cabin where the driver is. You see buildings where they put bulletproof plates in the facades. And you see vehicles that need to be both bulletproof, but also another value that armocks delivers is blasting proof. So it can withstand blasting, which is very important for these vehicles that moves around in hostile environments. And talking about different solutions and how we contribute to make things lighter and stronger, I think this is a good example from the real life. And you probably see this on the road every day. It's a regular tipper. And if you go back 25 years up to the very left, that's what a tipper looked like in the 90s. Very rigid, stiff boxes, a lot of welding, and a weight of typically four and a half tones. In the end of the 90s, we had a customer in Germany that came to us and we sat together and they said that they want to lighten up the tipper. And the solution is what we call a half pipe. Completely different design without stiffeners, but still actually better lifetime and so on. And all of that at this point, you can see that we saved one and a half tones in this solution. Over the years, the design has been refined, materials have been developed, and the solution today using the most modern technique weighs about half, what it did 25 years ago. So this means that the end user can hold payload instead of dead weight on the road. And SSAB has been behind all of this development. It's our experts and salespeople going market by market, customer by customer, sifting together with the ones producing trailers, coming up with different solutions, and this is where we are today. So you can think about that when you're out driving now. Look at the truck box. This is most certainly the design you will see and that's us behind that development. Now I will show you a movie and it illustrates how we have been working in order to develop very concrete advices because you get questions when you sit down with a customer here. How do we design? What can we expect? So we have developed a very applied way of testing. You will see how that relates to the everyday life of a tipper and you will also see at the very end a proud customer in Turkey, demonstrating in his workshop how Hordox can withstand really high impacts. So here we go.
