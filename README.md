Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Guarantee Trust Holding Company, half here 2025 investor analyst conference call. All attendees will be in this in only mode. There will be an opportunity to ask questions when prompted. If you need assistance during the call, please signal an operator by keying in stock and in zero. Please note that this event is being recorded. I will now hand you over to Shigun Apache. Please come ahead. Good afternoon everybody. Thank you for coming on to the call. The investor presentation was put out on Thursday, so we'll just go straight to Q and A. So I'm ready for the first question. Thank you very much for joining. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please key in stock and then one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation turn will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may key in stock and then two to leave the question queue. Just a reminder, please ensure that you limit your questions to two per analyst. We further request that you ensure that your line is unmuted and your background noise is limited when asking your question. Our first question comes from Timothy Wombu. Of ATC, please go ahead. Thank you and good afternoon. Hi Shigun. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from my end. I'll try to get into the described number. The first question is on giving the capital raising that you have a mark tone, give us a sense of whether your effects equity position changes from what was previously there after the London listing. My second question is a bit more clarity on the financial assets recoveries that you made that appear in your color or not. Then maybe just making one more on your dividends policy with regards to what should expect for the current financial year. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. I will, as usual, I try to elaborate a little bit just in case there's a question that's related. The first things the capital raise didn't change the long position because it was converted into an IRA since we had to invest in the bank. So the long position remains the same. Capital raise that was done from the UK is now in the bank and so the bank has met it by $500 billion. In terms of recovery, that recovery was basically out of gather. So they had made a provision on the name. So it's actually recovery that was made in gather, I believe. In terms of dividends, let me spend just a little bit of time because I'm sure that a lot of people might have a question on dividends. The first thing I always say about an interim dividend and hopefully I'll clear it is that you don't blow a full-time whistle at half time and basically an interim dividend is just a bit symbolic and so we've chosen to pay one IRA which means that we can use the rest of the year to work with the income we have. If you take the quality of the results, you would see for great analysts like yourself that if you take the PAT and you back out 15% statutory reserves and 5%, that tells you how much we could have paid a dividend. That's how strong the quality of earnings are. We will retain our 60% of the policy so very easily you can work backwards into what we could have paid. Hopefully if we're on track to the end of the year again, it will tell you what we can pay because these results have really no revalvety shown derivatives. So a different policy stays the same and I just try to give a bit of a rational as to why we only paid one there and what we could have paid a half here. I believe that answers your question. Yes, it does. Maybe just a quick rejoin that on that. If you could just confirm that 60% pay out policy, 60% excluding the FX revaluations. If you don't mind, maybe just repeat the exact Well, in this case, we're going to have 6.5 billion derivatives. So these earnings this year are very different from last year. So yes, excluding FX revaluation but FX revaluation is immaterial in the results you see at half year 2025. Right. Maybe just a quick one on the FX equity position. So that doesn't change. I don't mind just, if you could remind us what value you have to ask for that. $820 million. $820 million. Yeah. All right, thanks. Thank you. The next question comes from Rona Godia of the Don Ross. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, Shagan and what? Congratulations for the results and thanks for taking the time to take my questions today. Perhaps if you don't mind, I might just, my first question is just really a continuation of Tim's question on dividends. Like mentioned, it's the policy of 60%. I believe of core earnings. So maybe could you just clarify if the first up results was just 100% core earnings because like you mentioned, the FX revaluation gain was pretty low or was there some non-core element to it that we should be adjusting? And also on this dividend policy. So if I look at your numbers now, around 65% of your Nigeria, I'm guessing you're not upstreaming profits from the other subsidiaries. So I was wondering if, you know, can you sustain a policy of policy out of 50 to 60% given that the contribution of Nigeria has decreased and presumably should continue decreasing because you should see stronger growth outside or should we estimate, you know, the dividend policy should be 60% of Nigeria's profits. If you could just clarify that. And so that was just the dividend question. The second question is on maybe your asset allocation. We saw the central bank reduce the CRR by 5 percentage points last week. Just what's the implication for that? How much liquidity does that release into your balance sheet? And just maybe related to that, when we look at your balance sheet, apart from the CRR, there was a huge amount of cash holdings in USD. Maybe could you just help us understand, you know, why you're holding such a significant liquidity position. And now with, you know, the macro environment improving, if we could see some of that liquidity being deployed into, you know, private sector loans. Thank you. Okay. Sorry, I've just kind of taken the last one. And I can always say, if I don't answer everything, please come back so I can give you a clarification. In terms of the dividends, just like I had explained, always look at the dividends. Don't look at the dividends. We pay just looking at income in Nigeria because we can always pay dividends out of the subsidiaries. And if you look at that result, we paid $40 billion out of Ghana up into Nigeria into the bank. So please always look at your potential as 60% of the bank because we know how we can work it. And you can always pay dividends out of the countries that come up into Nigeria. So I would say always focus on the total bank profit, take the P80 at bank level and take 60% of that. So that's the simple answer to dividends. If you look at, and I will spend some a little bit of time on 2025, half year one results, really the results that half year 2025 were pretty pleased with because it's really basic or core earnings. And it will also start to answer some of your third question. If you look at those results, the loan book is of 20.5%. This really is the first term we pushed like this in the last five, six years. And we've only started. The fixed security income securities went up 9.17%. So again, we were not pushing fixed income securities. We pushed the loan book beyond that. We also then have cash and cash equipment. You say we have a lot of cash. No, we only grew that too. So that's our dollar cash position, which we're yet to disperse. Because we're not growing the dollar loan book aggressively because the yields there are lower and we can make more money. And so the split in the loan book today is 52.48. So there's no aggressive dollar growth. And then if you look at deposits, deposits have grown 19%. So this is really core income that you will see. The revaluation and derivative gains in that profit is only 6.5 billion. So we're very happy with the quality of earnings. It is really cash-based. It is not non-cash. Which is why the tax rate this year is 25%. It gains the tax rate of last year, which was 10%. Because most of that was non-core. So in terms of asset allocation, you can see what's beginning to happen. CRR, we're going to see our release of 230 billion. Which means we can deploy it into loans. We can deploy it into fixed income. We're not going to do anything crazy. We're going to continue to grow the loan book. As we told people when we were raising capital, we think we can do a 30% loan growth going forward. And you can see we're 20.5. So really, if you look at our asset allocation going forward, you start to see a bit more aggression with the loan book, quality, low risk. You will see us still play the fixed income book because it's still profitable. But we might not point as fast and you'll see cash and cash equivalent coming down. And they see us what you should expect in terms of asset allocation going forward. And you should expect there will be more of the loan book in local currency versus foreign currency. I don't know if that answer your three questions. No, it does. I will get back in the queue for some follow-ups. Okay. All right. Thank you. The next question comes from Gloria. The DPA of CSL stock brokers. Please go ahead. Gloria, your line is open. You can ask your question. Yeah, good afternoon. Can you hear me? Yes, I can now. Okay. So I just wanted to figure out the loan growth. You're talking about what sectors are they typically from? Well, if you look at it, I would say it's basically three main sectors, manufacturing, a little bill of oil and gas and retail. Those are basically the sectors we're growing. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And then one. As a reminder, please ensure that you limit your sales due to question per analyst. We further request that you ensure that your line is unmuted. Any background noise is limited when asking your question. Going on to the next question, which comes from wall K from frontier capital. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for the call. I'm wondering if you could provide some color on the sharp increase in deposit costs that we've seen this quarter? Next. Okay. Couple of things. Well, I want to raise that sharp. We're 2.2, which is still pretty good. But part of what you see on a group basis is that, you know, most of all, some of it is from the bank. There's obviously a bit of pressure for pricing on deposits as you started to see basically a widespread or fixed income. But some of it is also the asset management company's cost. They now have about 600 or 5 billion in AUM, which have an interest cost. We also have some areas outside of Nigeria, especially East Africa, where a lot of it is wholesale. But truly, I still think or we believe that the cost is on the controller 2.2. Even with a cost of 2.2, we're still back in the news of about 12.4. So we think the two. We look at a yield of 14.6. We'll look at a cost of 2.2. We have a mean of 12.4. We still think it's under control. So it has gone up, but I wouldn't say it's out of control by any means. I don't know if that's also the question. Yeah, that's very helpful. If I could ask one more. I'm just looking at the balance sheet. It looks that there was quite a large write-off in Q2. Could you give it a color on that? Yes. We have completely de-risked this balance sheet. We have an oil and gas name that was left that most people might take the position that is still performing, but we take in the position that we don't like the performance. And so we basically written that off, and we will recover our money. I'm choosing at this point not to mention the name because I think for a lot of people they still see performing on their books. So yes, we did take one write-off off. And then what that has done as far as we're concerned to the risk on our lower book is that you will see that in stage 2, in three sentences to stage 3. So we did think we should do that. We think it's a prudent thing to do. If this second half of the year, it happens to be different and the rest of the market is correct or where we're all, then we'll write it back. Understood. That's all for me. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Olamide Solley, of Renaissance Capital Africa. Please go ahead. Hello, good afternoon. So I'll switch to my question. I just wanted to ask regarding the Lombu goods, which you might have said earlier. That's how we're expecting about 30% Lombu goods here in the year. And that's this year I'll be looking at it from after this year or the year is going ahead. And just looking at those with the double-cent goods. That's not that high this year. I'm not really seeing the opposite goal. So if Lombu goods is at 30% and the opposite of that is not really going, that's the trend of implied. I will see an LDR issue. And I just want to get clarity on that. It's not the new expectation. It's that's the... Because statistically LDR has been quite low. So this does seem like the LDR increases significantly for demand. And most just that. One of those locks they got in. Yeah. For the government securities, they have been... Yeah. For the balance sheet, the government securities have taken a very significant portion of that. You start to see Lombu goods. So they have more size. So particularly LDR. Government securities. That's all for my end. Okay. Sorry. I think I might have answered some of these questions, but I'm going to ask for them again. The first thing is, I don't know what you look at, but deposit growth is 19%, which is actually strong against low growth of 20.5. So we're going to grow our deposits in tandem with our low growth. So as we approach 30% low growth, we're going to put the deposit growth growth closer to that. So what you will see in this minimum name line is as much as possible, our deposit growth and our low growth. We're not just going to grow deposits for the sake of it. We're going to grow it where we can go into earning assets. And then like I said earlier on, we are going to prioritize low growth going forward. We will continue to grow fixed income, but as you can see, we've done 17% versus 20%. So yes, you will see us be emphasized fixed income growth. We will favor deposit growth. Our prognosis is that you're going to see a decline in interest rate curve. And then as interest rates come down, it's a good time to switch some of your assets allocation from fixed income to low growth. So you're going to see us start to do a bit of that. Yes. Hope that answers your questions. Yeah. Regarding LDR, that's a long-term deposit ratio. Listen, LDR for me is a portion of what you're doing with your deposit on your loan group. If you had LDR of 28%, we're not even in a realm of where we're worried about LDR now. When you start to approach 70% low to deposit ratios, you start to get what? At 28%, what you focus on is growing your loan book, growing your customer deposit so you can fund it. When you get to 70% LDR, you start to ask a few questions. We're still too far from that at 28% LDR. Okay. Okay. Yep. Thank you. The next question comes from Precious Jugerri on cardinal loan securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Yeah. Yeah, so let's go to the question. Yeah. I would like to get a sense of how the bank is assessing the new non-TSSCR out of 75%, you know, any implications on the bank. Secondly, could you please speak to the reduction in deposits on banks, you know, about 36% decline there yet to date, which of course emanated from an almost absolute draw of money market deposits. And only if someone has asked this question already for income tax expense. We noticed that 50% jump coming in, which could you provide some insight around that as well? Thank you. Okay. First of all, I have answered some of this, but I'll ask another game. CRR, the 75% as you can imagine, if you look at what, what, it's three, four, governance, like three, four percent of our deposit base. So the 75% do you do manage your loss. But we were in the net competitive total of 30 billion. So that tells you where we were in terms of the 75% bill. We actually bring better for 50, 45% in terms of tax. Yes. We went up from 10% to 25%. And that tells you about the quality of earnings. You do not, when you see a low tax rate, it means that the profit you're looking at is non-cash. Last year, of the 1 trillion PBT, 623 billion of it was non-cash base, so we didn't pay tax on it. This year, the 600 billion you see is all cash outside of 6.5, which is why we have paid 25% tax. And that is the reason for the increase in the tax, because the quality of earnings this year is cash based. So that's the simple explanation there. I don't know what money market we are not really a money market place. And what you look at when you analyze this as a bag is basic customer deposits. And our customer deposits are up 90%. And then I'll answer your questions. Yes, thank you. The next question comes from Larry Balluru. Who's an investor? Please go ahead. Hi, Shae, sorry, it's Landry from Chapel Hill. Hi, how are you? They said you're an investor, but you are anyway. Well, yes. Yes, Chapel Hill is. Thanks. Curious on, you know, over the weekend and lastly, your barrage of guidelines and new regulations from the pension regulator. And of importance of, yes, critical note is the new capital requirements and how you're seeing it and how they impact the strategy in that business vertical for you. Okay, thank you very much. First of all, I've been educated that a year to gain is paid up. I hope we share all this funds. But the truth is for us, it's not a big deal. We're at about 10.5 billion of paid up in our PFA. It means that we need to raise another 9.5. Quite frankly, all we have to do is retain maybe about 20 cobalt dividends at the point where we need to do it in the holding company and we can capitalize it. So, from our perspective, we think we'll get to 20 billion very easily. What do I think you'll do through the industry? I'm not sure it will change the competitive position significantly. I think the big players will get to the figures very easily and that the people who will be affected are the small players. But when we stand, I think we can see our way through to the 20 billion quite easily. For us, it's about no point in buying. There's a leg to that, right? So, it's that 20 plus a per cent of AUMs. I've been given what you are. You know, no material. Exactly. Good thing is we don't have that problem yet. We're at about 1.30 something. But I think the way you will deal with the 500 billion as you approach it, you see for us, is that you will just start putting more, leaving more money in the business. I really am not sure yet because it's not my own problem whether they think it's going to be paid up or at that point it's going to be shared hold as funds. But for now, we've dimensioned our own problem where we don't have the over 500 problem. So, for now, our only problem is the 20 billion. Clear. All right. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Gabriel Desmond of WSTC Financial Services. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Can you hear me now? Yes. Good afternoon. Okay. So, I was logged out. My question is with declining news and race courts, which would likely see more court happening in November. I would like to see a decline in your cost of funds and also your borrowing rates. Well, declining yields. Yeah, we will always move with the market. I wish sometimes if you could answer this question with 100% certainty you would be in orbit. I think even as yields decline, you won't be as drastic as you make out and that things will be more gradual. And that at all times what we will try and do is protect our NIMP. And we like our NIMP in where it is. It's about 12.4. So, we will continue to play to preserve that NIMP. And we will respond to what the market is. But where I sit today, I do not see a dramatic shift in yields so far since the MPC. So, we'll wait and see. We'll respond. Cost of funds might come down. But for us, cost of funds is 2.2. So, the upside for a reduction in cost of funds is not at great. So, what we will have to do is manage more of the yield on the asset side. But we'll wait and see. I mean, we're not going to die a thousand deaths. And we really don't believe that there's going to be any dramatic shift in yields between now and the year end. It's the position we're taking. All right. So, what our, what our, your DIMP, NPM is your institution for the year end. I think I already said that. Do you have a pair of ratios or changes? 60%. We like the quality of earnings that we see at this rate. We feel really recorded that we'll definitely pay a high, depending on 2024. All right. Thank you very much. All ladies and gentlemen, just a reminder, if you'd like to follow the question, he will be key in star, and then one, a new telephone keypad. Once again, please ensure that your line is unmuted, and your background noise is limited in asking a question. Our next question comes from Tajudin Ibrahim of Chapel Hill Denim. Please go ahead. Thank you so much, and congratulations on your numbers. The first question I would like you to, to give further color on actually is what your, your product expectations are when we talk about interest rates, considering that we have entered, you know, a few fish monitoring cycle. So it's to be useful if you can guide us into what you would expect into chances and mistakes. And I think the stock continues. I did not really get what your, you will have pair of ratio, you know, targets these. Did you say 60% or something lower? If you can clarify that, I will appreciate its thanks. Okay, first of all, it was 60, 60, 60 demand pair ratio. In terms of, in terms of dividend expectation, well, you saw there was a 50 basis cut, in places down at about 20% levels. So my expectation is that interest rates in 2026 are the trend is downwards, and that the businesses and the portfolio use will adjust according to ask me what my expectations are when a drop in interest rate environment going forward. So, so, so, just so to add, you know, one, one bit, the capital that you risk, you know, risk definitely would you say that because, you know, fully being deployed, or do you want to just, you know, split? So it's, you know, just so that we have a good sense around the deployment of that last capital, thanks. First of all, it's been fully deployed, but as you can imagine, you wouldn't see the good things Chapel Hill did and worked on this transaction. So you won't see it in half year results because that capital came in in July, but it has been fully deployed. And what you see as we go forward, as I've said, is we will probably change the asset allocation as we go forward. Maybe some more of it is a fixed income going forward, more of it might go into loans. Still shuffle it, but as of today, fully deployed in earning assets. So, yes, capital started to work. Okay. Now, yes, it does. I just do not know if you will be willing to speak to what your biggest sector would be in terms of lending, you know, from the current, you know, period into 22 districts. What would be your biggest lending sector? Thanks. I think it will be manufactured. I think it will be manufactured basically. We're pretty happy with where our oil and gas book is. So you won't see any major shifts. You might see pay thousands. We might see that. We would also hope to increase our, you wanted biggest. So the biggest will be manufactured. But the other sectors where we would like to give some strength to would also be retail and SME. All the gas would be a maintain. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. I think we're done with that question. Apologies. The next question comes from Sekima Tukwa of Ashmoor Group. Please go ahead. Hi, Shagun. Hope you can hear me. Thanks for the... Yes, sir. Okay. Perfect. So slightly random question. But in terms of your sort of understanding of the process of the London line where capital was raised, and then the D.R.s, previous D.R.s been converted into this so that there are more shares available, i.e. more liquidity on the London line. I'm struggling to get much of sort of a definitive timeline from my custodian. Just curious as to what you're being told about the process, how far we are from the likes of Chapel Hill or others. You're sort of in contact with, please. Oh, I think everybody's done. And that all that is left is the issuance of the Master CCI, which is an ECCI. So we will get that. There are no other things. In fact, the person, the person who probably has the greatest side to this point is City Bank's custodian. I'm sure, like I said, all things for fungibility are in place. And I'm sure you know the rules as well around fungibility, which is your capital importation has been in guaranteed trust bank shares. And you can go in and out. So we're just waiting for issues and Master CCIs. Okay, perfect. I'll chase up on that. And then the second and final one from me was, obviously, you've talked about the risk-weighted asset growth. I'm curious when you look at the sort of pipeline, let's say at the end of June versus the pipeline end of June 2024, are we talking sort of multiples in terms of what corporates are signing to? It may or may not be drawn down, but obviously purely in terms of that origination side of things. How exciting is that prospect compared to where we were a year ago? Well, God, I think that you're from one way or two of us like night and day. I think you've had, I think, the reforms have settled well into the system. You have dollar liquidity. You have interest rates that make sense. So a year or two ago, our loan growth was probably under 5%. Now our loan growth is 20%, which means we are comfortable. The corporates, I also believe, are doing more regular business. Nobody's front-loading. So a lot of the activity you see today goes about what's going on in the economy. And that is the only reason why I would be able to say to you, we are optimistic enough to go for 30% loan growth going forward for a group that we wouldn't even talk to you about loan growth before. So I think there is optimism. There is liquidity. Interest rates are right. Demand is growing. So I don't think the most corporates, at least the corporates we have on our books, are open for business and are looking to do business. Thank you. The next question comes from Timothy Wombu. Please go ahead. Thanks. Just a couple of full-up questions. The first one is, so arguably we could say that forbearance really helped manage income formation from early 2020 to date. Now you plan to grow your risk assets. It sounds quite aggressive, you know, if you look at the prime lending rates, it's north of 50%. Would you be worried about income formation? And I look at this with the lens of East Africa, where I love to interest rates, you know, have seen, for instance, industry and real ratio in the mid-teens. I'm just wondering now without that forbearance, which is a proper, you say, you know, guard against income formation. Do you think that's a new year of concern? My second question is that you do not provide any guidance in your presentation. I'm just curious why. And I think this might help to answer the question on the expectation of the data. I think most of us are looking at 60% of your core profits, and it looks like a significant figure. And I think it would help if we had your protection for Fourier. So I think we are sort of elevating at how significant it would be. So because if I look at your evaluation gains, they were not as significant. 19 billion unrealized effects came together with, I realized gains on four transactions. About 30, 30 billion. So maybe I think that's what you're trying to get at, so keep on asking about the review. Thank you. Okay, you're an extremely great analyst. So I'm going to leave you to work to the number, but I'm going to try to help a little bit. First, let me apologize. The reason we didn't give a guidance this year was that we had to do the transaction, and we were told not to try to lead the market with any guidance. Obviously, by half year, we really didn't think it was worth doing a six-month guidance, so I apologize, but that's why we didn't do a guidance for this year. As you have rightly said, if you look at the earnings and half year, there's little or no derivative gain there, unlike last year, which was 623 billion. The central bank then says remove 15% for statutory reserves, remove 5% for SME. That's a 20%. The rest of it, honestly, after tax is available. You will then determine what percentage of that you want to pay out. I'm not... We never really guide too much about dividends, but I think I've given enough of a direction as to how you can come into the dividend. Also, for you to understand that we are very happy with the quality of earnings, you would see that the tax rate is up, is 25%. Higher than the tax paid on one trillion because this is all cash-based, and the central bank allows you to pay dividends on cash-based profit after statutory deductions. So that's how we're going to arrive at the dividend. You can work all those numbers and you would see, like I said, the only thing I'm willing to get a comment on is that I do believe it will be better than last year from where I sit today. For barriers, we didn't have that many for barriers. We're going to be very careful, and it depends on what your credit risk appetite is. We're not just going to grow the low book stupidly because we said 30%. If we don't find quality lows, we're going to grow. We're going to try to diversify it. So we're going to try not to pick up MTLs as we grow the low book, but please trust us, we're not throwing caution to the wins. We'll be very careful, and we don't intend to grow a low book at the expense of an MTL. I would also hope that there will never be four purposes again. I'm not sure that's necessarily a good practice, and that people should make sure that they do their risk assessments properly, and if lows are bad, you should provide for them. And if they're performing, you don't provide for them. I think that will keep everybody in. Keep this all the way back as you do, which is the best credit probably. So I'm not hoping, or I do not believe, you'll see a spike in our MTLs as well. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Olamide Solé, of Renaissance Capital, Africa. Please go ahead. Yeah. Just a couple of questions, a couple of a couple of questions. I saw that for traders here. It's more than doubled. From 10% to 4%, compared to after 10% to 5%. However, I was just a big curious, is it really related to the LSCO frame? Also, I wanted to ask regarding the Capital adequacy issue. I can see that the LSCO frame, the grandma's was there, was it included in the competition? So, if we include it, what will it be at? Also, looking at the level of the capital adequacy issue, kind of organic because it helps a lot. So that's just my question. Okay. Thank you. Obviously, it's not like the capital didn't come into July, so it's not enough of a result. It's 36% at half here. Unfortunately, I don't have the figure for you post-half here, but I can get the energy to send it to you. So, I didn't have more than enough capital. Is it too high? It's high, but we'll work it down slowly. The worst thing you want to do when you have this kind of capital add accuracy ratio is go on a low spree. All that will happen is that you pick up MCLs. So, we'll deploy this capital very sensibly and bring down the capital adequacy ratio over time. This is something we tend to do overnight. The fixed income growth had nothing to do with, obviously, the London listing. London listing didn't happen from July. So, the fixed income growth has to do with a couple of things. Depose and growth, and then partly the capital we raised in August, which came in in January. So, more of the last capital raised less than London. Okay, I made the treasury she has. The treasury she has not the fixed income. The treasury she has. So, what do you mean treasury she says? In Nigeria, you're not allowed treasury. You don't do treasury. I'm a little confused. Okay. The treasury she has only the capital adequacy competition. Yeah, that will be part of your fixed income book. Okay. Okay. I get that. Okay. One more. One more question. Okay. I get that now. And one more question. I'm going to ask the guidance. The business expansion regarding PSC's analysis management where was the co-coilate thing, pushing the strategy. Oh, God. We're very happy, by the way, with these businesses. If you look at group contribution, East Africa today 1.5% of group. And we've been at it for 10 years. And we'd be sweating it. We bought these businesses three years ago. They went nothing. They were in 1.4% of group. Half your profit is around $9 billion from these three small businesses. So I think we're on track where different phases of happiness. I think we've had very pay. And the asset management business, we're more happy with pension. We're less happy. But you know, you've got to balance everything. So if I take the three new businesses, I would say we're fairly satisfied with where we are. We paid the $11 billion for these businesses. We're going to make it about $20 billion a year for three years. I would say it was a decent investment. Okay. That was my question. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, just a further reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please key in star and then one on the telephone keypad. Our next question comes from Paul Kelly of Ventura Capital. Please come ahead. Could you comment on the magnitude of NPL formation in just in Q2, not in the first half? Can you talk about what sectors you saw that NPL formation in? And then also just generally do you view this as a kind of normal amount of formation or extraordinary? Thanks. Okay. From our perspective, I would call this extraordinary. I think we just like I said earlier on, we had one loan in the oil and gas sector, which by the way, the reason I'm being very careful about not throwing the name out there is I think every on the back has decided this loan is performing. We've chosen it's not. I'm taking the provision. So I'd say it's extraordinary. In a general course of events, at least from all over, we're not seeing anything out of whack. We do think NPLs are under control, quality of loans seem to be okay, which is why if you look at the composition of our stagey of our loans when 94% stage one, 1.8% stage two and about 4% stage three. So from that perspective, it tells you what we think is happening on our balancing terms of NPLs. But we chose to do something quarter two and take that one provision, which was around $50 million. So I would call it an extraordinary provision we took in quarter two. Okay. Understood. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we have no further questions in the question queue. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you for everybody who came on. Yeah. I look forward to talking to you about any of your results. Thank you. God bless. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's event. Thank you for joining us. Anyone else? Anyone else? Just connect your lines.
