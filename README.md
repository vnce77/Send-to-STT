Greetings. Welcome to the ASP Isotopes Investor Update Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference is being recorded. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you are listening via the webcast, you may submit questions over the web via the Q&A box on your screen. If you have dialed in and would like to ask your question over the phone, please press star 1 in your telephone keypad. Before we get started, please note that our remarks today may include four looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and after results may differ materially. During this call, we may use words like anticipate, could, enable, estimate, intend, expect, believe, potential, will, should, project, and similar expressions, which indicate four looking statements. For a more comprehensive discussion of these and other risks, please refer to our filings with the SEC available on SEC.gov. And in the investors section of our website, I'll now turn the call over to CEO Robert Ainsko. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to ASP isotopes the quarter update call. I'd ask everybody to take a moment to look at these forward looking statements. My name is Robert Ainsko. I'm the interim chief executive officer and chief operating officer. I'm joined on the call today with Paul Mann, who's a co-founder and I'm myself and the executive chairman of ASP isotopes. Also present is Heather Keasling, the chief financial officer and ASPI. I'm also asked to join this call Dr. Rylo Batorias, who is the chief executive officer of nuclear energy subsidiary quantum bleep energy and his CFO, Michael Kenneth. I'll begin with taking you through an update on our operational isotope enrichment plants in South Africa, starting with our multi isotope plant, which is currently enriching silicon 28 and electronic semiconductor gas. So this plant is enriching silicon 28 for our initial two customers for that product. We shipped commercial samples of silicon 28. These samples have been validated for our topic purity with our customers. Our customers are in fact visiting the plant in September for a very, very constructive visit with their senior engineers and our senior engineers and that led to some agreed modifications to that plant which are nearly complete and will have the effect of improving the enrichment rate and also smoothing transition through to the next semiconductor gas that we wish to enrich after silicon 28, which is germanium. The modifications I said are largely complete and the plant is continuing to process the first commercial batch. We also secured another silicon 28 contract as you're in the quarter and we're looking to deliver and satisfy all the current customer owners in 2026. The other important update on our semiconductor gas vertical is the acquisition of germanium. This was announced earlier in the year and we have been working on completing the acquisition as well as overseeing the important phase 1c which is defined as bringing the initial plant to a main plate capacity. In terms of the acquisition process we are approved on all but one of the conditions precedents which is one regulatory approval left to receive which is the exchange control which is expected to pretty infinitely. All other approvals such as shareholder support which was near the unanimous and competition commission approval have been received and we successfully listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange earlier this year in the preparation for the share exchange and completion of the transaction. In terms of phase 1c which has been a majority focus for prevalence of the reserve and the commercial delivery of the expected product but that's going incredibly well. The difference is that we've seen since the restart following our investment is a larger number of drilling groups operating in series and the contracting of McKinley exploration who's experienced in gas drilling is enormous and they have provided a lot of insight into reservoir modelling and the targeted drilling in locations to improve the effective volume of gas. Also important to note is the compressor station which brings gas from the further fields as is now nearly complete. The inclusion of the ASPI engineering team can have been adding their support to the maintenance and running of the plant. Now I'll take you through the nuclear medical updates. So our first quantum enrichment plant which those of you that are familiar with the company will recall is our proprietary technology related to the laser enrichment of isotopes. The first plant has now been in the production following commissioning earlier this year and is currently producing new Tervium 176. We shipped a commercial sample of Utervium to a customer for independent analysis and are awaiting the results of that. The delivery of commercial quantities is expected to take place over the course of the first half of 2026. We've also started procurement for in total four new production facilities for QE. The first new one will be a second Utervium production plant and we've also secured the regulatory approvals from all four of the plants and during the course of 2026 we expect to be delivered commissioned and we hope to start out bridging the linium nickel zinc. I'm also saying that you saw the Ferbarium one through seven. So our carbon plant is which is expected to start producing carbon 14 prior to encountering feedstock delivery delays with our partners in North America. We started not being regulatory based delays which have now been resolved but there have been some feedstock concentration issues encountered which are now largely being resolved and our first full batch so that we can continue processing is expected to be in January 2026. We continue to expect to ship the first commercial batch in the first half of 2026. In the meantime we have been utilising the asset which has been commissioned since the middle of last year and have been reaching carbon 12 for our global gas company and we said to sample commercial carbon 12 and initial feedback has been positive and we expect to ship commercial products still in December. So otherwise on the nuclear medical updates in terms of pet lands we have been investing the capital efficient banana into the growth of our South African radio pharmacy. The equipment that we've installed then in the cyclotron and PET CT scanners have been commissioned and are fully operational. This has led to the anticipated growth in volumes and doses sold and therefore revenues. We have also on the Commission on the received regulatory approval for our SPECT pharmacy which is now fully operational and the delivery of SPECT doses is increasing ahead of the scheduled uptick in the delivery that was predicted. Of note also is the very exciting part of PET which is the therapeutic update where we ship the first of TCM177 first in South Africa so we're very excited about that and expect a demand for that to grow. Otherwise on the global scale of pet labs South Africa having been the proving ground and showing our ability to purchase, install, commission and get regulated the radio pharmaceutical equipment and start delivering doses. We've made our first purchase in the United States of America. We announced the purchase of East Coast nuclear in Florida and we will be growing that to radio pharmacy in more detail to follow. We also have a second radio pharmacy under term sheet which we expect to close in the very near future and we have a number of others in due diligence. So at this point I will pass over to Dr. Rylian Pretoria's to talk about the opportunity and nuclear energy accordingly. Thank you Robbie. I'd like to share some updates and progress at QLE. QLE is acquired 137 to commercialise the cutting-edge creepy unit technology that provides a modular system to address beta decay related nuclear waste treatment at the source of emission. QLE plans to convert hazardous CZM-137 to commercially-viable barrier-137 by reducing the 30 and a half year half-life to mere minutes thus converting a liability into a revenue source leading to the semiconductor industry. Other beta emitters such as STRON-TIM-90 and COVID-19 from nuclear waste will be integrated into our nuclear medicine supply chain or tracychemical vertical perspective. QLE has made progress on our NLEU with Fermi and is providing reckless information to utilise the 11 gigawatt data center complex in Amarillo, Texas as a location for uranium enrichment to produce anti-U-plus handheld. The QLE technology is based on the foundational ASP isotope stable isotope separation technology that is commercial operation today and depending on regulatory approval these technologies will be developed to produce isotopes vital to the nuclear supply chain. Progress has been made towards operation of the existing test features at next-up and a dollar to produce heavy for terra power. Early engagement with the UK Office for the UK Regulation or R&L shows progress towards UK operation. Along with recruiting our CFO micro-cuttiff, QLE has raised 64.3 million dollars via convertible notes bringing our pro former cash on hand to 85.6 million dollars. QLE has also filed S1 documentation with the SEC highlighting our commitment to the states of ASP isotopes goals of spinning out QLE in Port of Ford, 2025. Over to you, Michael. Thanks, Rano. QLE is more than just an enrichment company. Our mission is the stabilisation of a dysfunctional nuclear supply chain by providing novel technical solutions to key risk areas thus providing a pathway to a robust, domestic, secure nuclear fuel supply chain. We're starting strong with commercial momentum through partnerships with industry leaders for commercial supply and funding and also led by a strong executive leadership team supported by our fast-growing execution focus team. We have exclusive and continued access to ASP isotopes team of 150 people in infrastructure and we're building our own team internationally. We will apply our scalable modular and demonstrated technology to enrichment of the critical materials required to support the nuclear fuel supply chain. Looking forward, we're going to continue to develop the foundational technology with support from ASP isotopes while engaging with regulators and expanding our commercial product offerings. At Q quantum energy, we aim to provide the world with future ready solutions. So we've assessed the current emerging and future need of the nuclear industry and identified several key chemicals in the form of high-priority isotopes required for stable operation. Current generation two and three reactors are dependent on adding you but also dependent on lithium seven which was produced historically and is currently being consumed from stock power. There's only one producer of lithium seven commercially in the world today and they set up outside of the western secure supply chain. It is therefore critical to start producing lithium seven to ensure the continued operation of the approximately 80% of nuclear reactors worldwide requiring lithium seven for page control but also looking forward to the massive uptake in demand required by molten salt reactors which will require kilotons of lithium seven in the form of fly and fly knack to function and demonstrate the capability. As part of producing lithium seven, we will also produce high-priority lithium six isotopes that will feed into the growing demand by the fusion industry for lithium six. Lithium six is used in fusion to produce tritium and by fusing tritium with deuterium, the fusion industry has now demonstrated double digits in seconds of continuous exothermic production of fusion power. We therefore believe that there will be a massive requirement for lithium six moving forward and we want to be the world's leading supplier of lithium six. The emerging and future demands for nuclear fuel is an interesting use case, an opportunity for Keelley to feature in terms of how generation three reactors can be advanced generation three plus reactors by switching to allu plus which is a high enriched form of allu between five and 10% and by going to this high enriched fuel, these reactors can increase their energy output or energy density as well as decrease the time between refueling cycles. Currently there's no secure supply chain either domestically or worldwide for allu plus and that is an opportunity for Keelley to feature in and that is a critical step towards our path to become the world's leading producer of Halo. As Haloley is between 10 and 20% in Richmond, which is of the end goal of quantum leap energy to become the world's leading supplier of Halo fuel. Over to Michael. Thanks Ryan. So thinking about our future and our expected company development roadmap, we intend to start our engineering design work in South Africa with our first demonstration plans to be operational there focusing on lithium and uranium. Our plan is to have demonstration plans in the US and the UK that will follow soon after. Our global headquarters will be in Austin, Texas as home to our laser center of excellence with Amarillo, Texas targeted for commercial US operations for heavy production. We envisage that our UK plant will produce for the UK and European consumption as well. We think about our organization in three distinct stages. We will invest through 2025 and 2027 in multiple demonstration and commercial plans that will focus on lithium and uranium in Richmond. We then deliver through optimization to achieve name plate output of enriched lithium and uranium. Finally, we'll accelerate our business as our revenues associated from our various products are repurposed through the business enabling further rounds of capital investment and output production. Over to you Paul. Thanks. I'm not going to explain the acquisition of skyline builders and when this fits into the API border strategy. So during late August, we acquired a controlling stake in a Cayman's entity listed on NASDAQ called Skyline Builders. It's historically been a construction company. We consider those assets largely non-core. Obviously it's up to the board of directors of skyline builders but we'd likely view those as being the best of somebody in the future. And the goal of this entity is to secure supply chains of critical materials that are both essential to the United States and to ASPI and quantum leap and energy. Shortly after point of control, we raised about forty one point seven million dollars capital into the business to facilitate acquisitions and growth. I've become the executive chairman of the company and Kimberly has two board members out of three on the entity and expect to announce the CEO to the next two months already chosen the CEO. He's just finishing off duties from elsewhere. We've made two acquisitions to date which we think are highly strategic to both the United States at large and also ASPI QLE. The first acquisition took place in October and we acquired a 20% stake in a privately held Delaware LLC that has essential critical materials in Asia. And these are extremely important to both the United States and ASPI and we expect to disclose exactly nature of these assets before the end of the year. We've had a lot of support from multiple governments to get this asset and we're extremely proud by what this asset can do and we're very excited by the future of this asset. More importantly we announced a couple of weeks ago that we proposed acquisition of a company called Supercritical. So Supercritical is a very unique US company, US technology developed by the DOE to extract uranium and other critical metals from seawater cost competitively and an industrial scale. Now it utilizes technology. It's been developed by the US government. US government spent about 20 million dollars over 10 years developing this technology and we're very excited by what this can bring to our supply chain. Obviously you know this fits in with a number of executive orders that have been signed over the last several months and we're very excited about bringing this to market over the next several months or years. I'm going to let the Supercritical CEO talk about this more in due course once the deal has been finalized. What this acquisition does for QLE is it means we become a soup to nuts nuclear fuel company. So Supercritical Technologies will focus on securing the feedstocks that our customers will need to make nuclear fuel. QLE will then plan to supply the conversion services also enrichment and deconversion. All of these are very much needed by Western world today. And then in addition to that QLE will supply Lithium 7 and Lithium 6 that are used in more consult reactors and also for pH controlled and pressure water reactors. And finally the pre-be technology which money described earlier will help deal with cleaning up a lot of the nuclear waste that comes out of a nuclear reactor. And so I think it's pushed QLE in a really unique position to capitalize in every part of the nuclear fuel supply chain and really become a nuclear reactors company of choice or partner of choice to supply those fuels. I want to hand back to Robert to talk about future milestones. Thanks very much Paul. I'm now going to give an update on the milestones on the corporate events that we can expect now and during the course of next year. So in terms of the corporate transactional events that we have coming there too in number the first is in time will be the completion of the religion acquisition. As I explained earlier we are waiting off one further regulatory approval that we will then enact the scheme of arrangements and complete the acquisition. This is going to be an excellent investment. We're very pleased with it. We're very pleased with the progress that's being made and the products are going to add to the stable of critical material products that ASPS folks are able to offer in quite a unique fashion to the semiconductor market. Secondly is the IPO of quantum leap energy. The subsidiary which you heard about earlier. So we will update the market on the detailed timing for this transaction but those of you following the stock will have noted that we confidentially file the S1 in preparation. Other than that the important job of work that we have in front of us is to complete the initial production runs of the operational plants that you've just heard about and across the three plants and fulfill the customer contracts that we have in front of us now. We also have had number discussions with our customers about their needs ongoing into the medium term that I think terms of quantum of the existing product mix and isotopes that they will be requiring in the future and will update the market in as much detail as we can when we can. In terms of the construction of new plants we will be during the course of 2026 a commanding construction of a number of plants in a number of locations namely we have certain lease on isotope super center as we call it in Iceland on the location there and we expect to break down on that for AFP technology based of plants during 2026. We also expect to begin plants and facilities in the US and the UK with the goal to enriching isotopes during the course of 2026. In terms of quantum enrichment laser based isotope enrichment plants we would like to begin construction parts during 2026 for plants which will deliver ZR again in the opening core and zinc isotope products for which we have demand from customers. We will also continue the expansion of our radiopharmaceutical footprint through our subsidiary pet labs global. For me this is a very exciting business where there's a lot of growth that's later and tend to deliver a thorough update to the market in the near future of the steps that we've taken to realize this and build a far very successful base case in South Africa where it's demonstrated our ability to commission and regulate and serve this radiopharmaceutical equipment and deliver dose to patients ultimately. So look out for more details about in due course. At this point I will hand over to you that it gives you the chief financial officer for the financial updates. Thank you Ravi. Good morning everyone. I'm delighted to introduce myself. I am Heather Kiesling, CFO of ASP isotopes. I will be presenting key operation metrics for the period ending September 2025. Starting with revenue, revenues include sales from our radiopharmaceutical operations in South Africa and beginning in September 2025 it also includes the revenues from Skyline. Excluding the Skyline revenues of 3.6 million results in total radiopharmaceutical revenues of 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2025 or an 18 percent increase versus the third quarter of 2024 and total radiopharmaceutical revenues of 3.6 million per year to date 2025 or a 24 percent increase versus 2024 due to both an increase in dose is produced driven by additional capacity and an increase in pricing. Next is operating expenses. Year to date total operating expenses increased by 16.5 million or 84 percent from 19.7 million in 2024 to 36.2 million in 2025. Non-cash stock compensation makes up approximately 30 percent public total operating expenses and the increase. Significant drivers of the increases are from the approximately 66 percent increase in headcount during 2025 supporting our research development plant activity and general operations as well as the significant increase in professional fees. Next we have net loss from operations. Net loss from operations is 34.9 million for year to date 2025 versus 18.7 million for the same period in 2024 due to the relative low volume of radiopharmaceutical revenue and low margin of skyline revenue the effect on net loss from operations is directly impacted by the operating expenses activity just mentioned. Next we have net loss before non-controlling interest from our non-holy-owned subsidiaries which is 96.5 million for year to date 2025 versus 23.2 million for year to date 2024 which reflects our other income and expense items on the statement of operations. The two largest contributors of this other income and expense activity is the over 300 percent increase in interest income in 2025 versus 2024 mainly due to investing our funds received from stock issuances over the last year and the impact of gap accounting for the fair value of the convertible notes guidance and activity of the fair value accounting of these convertible notes is further explained in the footnotes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our recently final ten queue. Year to date cash used in operations increased by 6.5 million or 50 percent from 12.9 million in 2024 to 19.4 million in 2025 mainly due to increases in research and development pertaining to next generation production technology for our current plants and future isotope production. The 66 percent increase in personnel in 2025 due to initiating commercial production increased R&D and business development and global operations and professional fees as we increase corporate activities. Further analysis is provided in the portion of our recently final ten queue. We have cash of 113.9 million as of September 30 2025. This balance reflects the net proceeds of approximately 56 million received during the third quarter of 2025 from the issuance of common stock in the 108 million year to date 2025 which was from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of warrants. Subsequent to September 30 2025 we have received net proceeds of approximately 200 million from the issuance of common stock. Quantum leak energy issued convertible notes in November 2025 totaling 72.2 million of which 30 million is from ASPI's chopes. And lastly property and equipment should grow from approximately 23 million as of December 31 2024 to 33 million as of September 30 2025 mainly due to our plant construction which has taken place in South Africa. We expect our cash burn from operations and continued growth of our plant plant and global radiopharmaceutical operations to increase as we bring more isotope enrichment plants online and acquire and expand our radiopharmaceutical targets. Further details will be made available in due course. Operator this concludes our presentation of our third quarter update call and we are now accepting questions from our attendees. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you are listening via the webcast you may submit questions over the web via the Q&A box on your screen. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question over the phone please press star one in your telephone keypad. Your first submitted question is as follows. Can you talk about the delays in shipping silicon 28? Well yeah we are going to go here again. So the delays refers to our previous needs of announced anticipated shipping dates. So this has to be seen within the context of the starting up and first production run of a nuclear engineering plant isotope enrichment plant which is an extremely complex chemical procedure and an extremely complex physical procedure. So the first production run has taken longer than we will have anticipated when we made those estimations previously. The big change that has happened for me this course was the visit that I previously mentioned from our issue to customers for silicon 28. I can't emphasize how incredibly positive that was really change in dynamic of the customer supplier relationship we want a lot of collaboration in terms of the modifications that I discussed and for us to be able to better gauge the demand that we can expect from those customers in the future around there and they're on the rise of total requirements. So the modifications and the general complexity involved in starting up with this nation. The current operations are going very well, I'm hoping to tell them. So I'm very happy with it. I'm continuously amazed by the capabilities of our engineering staff and they're more importantly our customers are very happy with the way we're doing things. So I'm very pleased about that and for those of you who of course would like to be answering the question. Thanks question, please. Your next submitted question. When do you expect to achieve operational de-risking in respect of Rennergen? What are the major milestones for the next six months? Yeah, thank you. So again, de-risking end of the first quarter is the simple answer to that question and what that involves is the completion of Phase 1c which I referred to earlier and that's defined as the bringing of the initial chemical plant that's currently already operational and producing both energy and helium that's in smaller quantities than that is required by the name of Phase 1c and that will be completed during current rate of progress by the end of the first quarter. At that point I will consider the project de-risk. There are discussions about what the arrangements for Phase 2 and work is going on in front of that for me with my Chief Operating Officer, Haton. My manager is Phase 1c, Phase 1c, Phase 1c, nothing else matters. So I'll make sure everybody is very focused on that to achieve promise of the plant and I'm de-risking that you're asking about. So that's the focus for me and I'll make sure that's the focus for people on the ground. So the amazing milestone in the next six months is two. It's very simple. It's completion of the transaction so that we perform the share slot over the company and that's how the aforementioned completion of Phase 1c. Those are the two things of a key focus. Next question, please. Your next submitted question, when will the company begin to recognize revenue in its isotopes enrichment segment? So revenue recognition, I think it's an accounting, so I think the purpose of the question is to us what we're going to be doing to deliver commercial bachelor custody to the table. First of all, we come on by my manager. I've been expected to ship that still before the annual December. So when the bill gets paid and the revenue is recognized, that would be a subsidiary question for her that we should be able to do. And then in terms of civic among you, as I said, during the first half, first quarter and first half of next year, that goes to be the initial revenue, but we need to be supplying current with just the current. So we have in terms of what we supply during the course of 2026. So to talk to the question, end of the year for the first written year. Next question. Your next written question, what did the customers say about our samples of both interbium and silicon? Yeah, I think you got a lot of questions of its nature and I think it might be in some confusion of people. People seem to be hanging on commercial samples that say there's a technology work or not. So for those people who will be able to produce products or is it will be not the sample so indicate that. So if people are in that position, let me just make it clear that the technology does work as a total team already being enriched haven't been across the three parts. We've been testing with our own analytical facilities and then they've been as we've announced tested independently by customs account parties. We don't have also a lot to see if we have to be Muslim customers for the same time. All of them at some stage will require or have required samples. We do not intend to announce every time. We send a sample to a customer, it's just in the process. But when we ship the first samples we were invited, that's a material event that we made that's announced. In terms of the products that we make, there are two key features that are important to the products. Is it so the enrichment and the chemical purity, those are simply put the two requirements that our customers have. In terms of isotopic enrichment, there is between the two technologies that we use. But basically it's simple, you keep going until the enrichment that we require is reached. In terms of ASP, for example, it's you're using the force of gravity in the form of centrifugal force. So that remains active on the gas that goes through the plants and we keep enriched until the enrichment level is achieved. Some of the modifications, as I said earlier, in the thing I've designed to increase the rate of enrichment, those are that have been getting too technical. There are replacements of one type of valve with another. One, the diameter of pipe with another, to control by the speed of gas through the S.T. part. And that optimizes, if you like, the operating philosophy of the plant, that is now being as big brought into service in this city with the first of the price. It's an ongoing initiative process, seeking to achieve perfection. So in terms of the samples, our customers are analyzing samples. They are, they use the phrase timeout in terms of isotopic enrichment, chemical purity. I'm told by engineers and analysts that it's not the right phrase, but this one I know. So the customers are very happy with the results, which is the most important thing. And so on, we're not expected to repeat this. We're not expected to be making a mouse every time we ship the sample to a customer. It's an ongoing initiative process, a very specialized product. There's a strong working relationship between the SPI and our customers for the different isotopes by the nature of the isotopes. Next question, please. We will take our first phone question from the line of George Gianarchus from Canacord. Your line is open. Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking my questions. And thanks for this incredibly robust update. I appreciate it. So I have several questions. Maybe to start, you've sort of talked about and quantified a $50 to $70 million revenue opportunity in 26 and 27 around the Caribbean 176 in Silicon 28. Is that still a number we should think about and sort of a model for the next few years? So I, George, first of all, thank you very much for asking the question. So we're not this stage changing guidance that we've given before. I'm very aware that the market is keen to help the guidance and also a detailed explanation of the bridging to the 2013 revenue as specifically done. We are, as we said, things are taken slightly longer than our initial estimations to bring into service and so on, which is not a big issue for us from an operational point of view. But what it doesn't mean is that we're not in a position to each other think effects or amend our forecasts or the revenue indications that have been given yet. As I repeat, I'm very, very aware that markets are requires that is looking for that. And I can promise that we'll do our best to give the information that we can as soon as certain things are included. So we have a sort of confidence to give that updated projections and be best to be held to them. I do have, I just want to say this point, I've got a lot of sympathy for investors and for analysts. It is a pretty opaque business. So not only do we have the financial regulations, which everyone's sort of familiar with, which governs our day-to-day. In our industry, we also governs, because we deal with the Trump technology with the global and national nuclear regulators, who are extremely keen to understand and let's what's being planned to tell people about our operations. Once you've got those three parts, those two things, you've been in our customs. And the customs, I would love to be shouting from the rooftops as to who our customers are across the spectrum of the state in which it's verticals. And I'd love to be able to explain the detail about our relationships. But in the agreements that we have with them, it's right up at the top of them, that confidentiality is key. They don't want their competitors knowing where they're buying their isotopic products from, what enrichment levels they are, what they're paying for them. So it does make it difficult to give some of the kind of data that I know that investors analysts might do to feed their objective models. So you have my sympathy. But 16 to ask you a question, George, is that I'm not making any pressure alterations to the prior education state, but as we get to high level of clarity, internally we will seek to provide for guidance on projections as soon as we possibly can. I do have a couple more and they're about numbers. So on slide 20, you have a list here of five, the four or five, four isotopes, excuse me, where you plan to not only build facilities by the end 26, but also I'm assuming begin shipments probably the year following. So can you help us number one, understand the capital commitment in 26, like how much money you need to build those facilities? And second, what the revenue opportunity and revenue and even the opportunity to look like for those four, just so we can understand sort of a turn on invested capital. Thank you. George, I'm going to have to disappoint you. I'm sorry. We are going to give a full update to the market, but we're not in a position to give that detail breakdown against what we've already sort of disclosed to the markets on this call. But we will be having an answer to supply those details as soon as we possibly can. Fair enough. So I'll just switch gears. There's just a couple more here before I pass the mic. For QLE, you did mention, I think if I heard this correctly, an opportunity for LEU plus, I think that's new. Can you sort of talk about maybe this interest, what appears to be a shift in strategy, if we heard that correctly, and what sort of mechanics we should expect to bring capacity for LEU plus up and running. I think you probably rather hear from Dr. Ryan who you'll get a much better answer. Thank you. Dr. Ryan, are you on the line? Yeah, it's all right. So LEU plus, great question. I think depending on who you speak to, they'll say LEU plus is just Haiti. So we try to classify LEU plus as a special subcategory of Haiti, and within that subcategory, it is between 5 and 10% in Richmond. And the reason that we're actually looking at LEU plus was due to customer inquiry. So we contribute a little more about who that customer is or what they want at LEU plus for. But I think I've stated in the presentation that it increases the power density of a power plant. It can be retrofitted without matching technical modifications into an existing nuclear power plant of generation 3 to make a generation 3 plus. And it increases the time between refueling. In other words, it extends the life of these power plants. So they can provide power for much longer. It means we don't have to replace them. So it is an important shift in modernizing the existing nuclear fleet. I wouldn't call LEU plus a modification or a shift in what we plan to do. It is on the way towards LEU production. And some would even say it is, or it is Haiti production. So for us to get to Haiti, which is provisionally up to 19.75% Uranium 235 in Richmond, LEU plus would be 5 to 10%. So as we progress from natural Uranium with our enrichment technology at 0.7% Uranium 235 will go incrementally through the LEU space, which is 0.725% in Richmond, nominally 4.8%. And then as we progress to Haiti, which is 19.75 will go through the LEU plus space, which is 5 to 10%. And we can then provide clients with products that they can use that they're willing to pay for, that there's no secure supply chain for. And we will be one of the only producers of LEU plus in the world on the way to get to home, generating revenue early as we de-risk and scale our technology. I hope that answers the question. Thank you so much. And maybe, is it fair to say that this customer is this in addition to the customer, with whom you've already revealed at MOU or is it the same? Yes. So I can say that it's not TerraPower. We stand firmly committed to our ongoing regulation with TerraPower to produce Haiti in South Africa. We're still looking at meeting the timelines made public. And this is other customers driving forward. Is this US or South Africa, Dr. Rhino? I can't provide more information on that. We'll update in future. And last question, I'm sorry to ask so many, but you did have a pretty significant revenue recognition item in the third quarter from Skyline Builders. Is that something we should model going forward? And how should we think about this 3 million plus in revenue? Yes. So I think Paul answered that question pretty well, but I'll reiterate some of the important talking points there. The goal of KL is to secure a nuclear supply chain, which is pretty dysfunctional right now. And Skyline Builders is an acquisition that will secure the supply chain in terms of raw material, critical raw materials. So even though there is construction in this construction business at this moment, we don't foresee that moving forward. Okay. So that 3 million should basically go away for the future. Yes. We'll reveal more in the future, but there is nothing to call. Okay. Thanks so much for all the questions, all the answers to my questions, excuse me, and for the robust update. Have a good day. And that is all the time we have for our question and answer sessions. I will now turn the call back over to Robert Niesko for closing remarks. Thank you very much, Prater. I just want to thank everybody for joining and for interested in the company. This year of 2025 has been a phenomenal year, having brought three plants that we've been working on into operation. We've posted a lot of investors and IMSs to access events, a lot of customers, a lot of accounting parties. Everybody who comes to this, it's an enlightening experience for them. Anybody who can as we announce more investor access events, and those people that they can come, it gives you opportunity to really quantify something and take away some of the mysticism about what sort of ISIS movement which is and what ASPIs is actually doing. And we're looking forward to diversifying a broader way from just operational assets in South Africa, might make it easier for other people to or more people to visit as those come online. But seeing advance really gives an easy way to visualize how the company can grow in terms of its operations and hence its revenue. And that's what a lot of people get out of to those visits. 20, 26 promises to be adjusted as exciting and fast paced a year. So we are looking forward to getting stuck into that and forward to updating everyone. Past year end. Thanks very much indeed. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.
