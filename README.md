Hello everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. For those who I haven't met on the line. My name is Ryan Maloney. I work with BMO Capital Markets on the Institutional Sales Desk here in Toronto. I'm honored to have the Asante Gold team with me today. Sitting beside me is CEO David Anthony. And joining us virtually is CFO David Weins. I'm sure a lot of you on the line have seen the press release that went out Monday morning. A lot of us were in Colorado and I hope a number of you have had the chance to meet with both David and David during the conference. But clearly the focus was on the Q2 results and the near term outlook. I think most investors would have looked past the Q2 results but the key focus here for us today and for that release was really on the near term outlook. Back in July, there was a $500 million financing package that really transformed the company. We're sitting at a pivotal point right now with the free cash flow inflection coming up very quickly. So I think the focus is clearly shifting from the balance sheet to the month over month data points. And the reason we wanted to do this webinar today is because we are at that point. We did want to get investors and potential new investors up to speed on what's happening and walk through the progress that the team is making on site. From a logistical standpoint, we do have an hour here today. We want to make this interactive where David's probably going to spend about 15 to 20 minutes on the slides. And then we want to jump right into Q&A. So we encourage you to send questions. You should see a question box on the website. It'll come directly to me and I can read it out to the team. So please send those through. And with that said, I will hand the floor to David. Thanks Ryan and good morning everybody. And thanks for joining us. So maybe David, if we can go to the first slide. Okay, so Q2 was actually part of the story of what comes next. Q2, we already had some money in the house. Okay, we went to refurbish the baby on the pit. We mobilized the mining contractor significantly, you know, in December last year, we had about 13 trucks running as we came into Q2. We have about 35 trucks running and coming out of Q2 and into right now. We've now got about 75 trucks running on site. So stripping and rehabilitation of the pit has been a focal point for us for about now six months. We've also advanced the sulfide treatment plant, so that it's just about ready to start up. In fact, commissioning. I think we're in the last step today on the regal. Coming back to the to the results in Q2, you can see that we moved a lot more material this year than we did last year. Obviously, it's a very high stripping ratio. I think in around 44 to one. Okay, as opposed to last year was about 10. What that means is that we are well advanced in rehabilitating that pit. And in fact, we're going to be getting into some relatively high grade over the next two or three weeks. We call it the wow zone in our engineering group, but we're getting up north of 2.4 grams per ton. Not a lot of ounces being made. Most of our energy went into stripping and getting positions for this time. When we get the money into the house, which happened starting in early August, we actually got funding to our operations people at the end of August. So all of our debts were taken care of both with our local service providers are a trade payables and also, of course, with major supporters such as Kinross. Maybe David, we go to the next slide, please. So let's just take a look at what the second quarter look like in terms of stripping ratio that's in the bubbles on the top of those bar charts and also in terms of ounce production. And then let's take a look at what's planned. Okay, as I mentioned, we're coming into a high grade area of the open pit and that's going to continue for the next 18 months. All right, you can see the ounce production at Bibiani is going significantly north, so that this month we expect about 6,000 ounces being built. But by the time we get to December and January, Bibiani is humming along at about 30,000 ounces a month. Okay, you can also take a look at the grade. And as I mentioned, we're coming into a higher grade area of the pit. It's going to be sustained for about 12 months after November in the mid to us. Let's go to the next one, please. And of course, this is the sulfide treatment plan. I mentioned it's been commissioning now for about two months. And it's ready to start up the final piece is that VXP mill in the middle. That's a 1.5 megawatt motor. Okay, it was mounted about a month ago. The electrical gear to make it go arrived last week and has been hooked up. It was tested yesterday. We expect that plan to be running with solution from front to back at the end of this week and with slurry next week. Okay, I think a lot of people who have followed our story know that that sulfide treatment plan brings recovery from 60% up to 92%. Okay, so it's a game changer for Bibiani. It makes all of the ore below 100 meters, which contains sulfide makes all of that viable makes it makes Bibiani a very long term, very profitable operation, especially at $3,600 gold. We actually kicked off this project a few years ago, but it needed funding. We kicked it off. It was a $30 million project. I think the final ticket price now is about $31 million before tax. Okay. FLS is our principal process partner. Okay. And of course, we've got the Octan reactor, which makes a lot of difference with metallurgical performance. Let's go to the next slide, please. All right, that moving to Toronto. Okay, Toronto had a strong first quarter, second quarter, had some operational issues principally with explosives. Those have been ironed out. Toronto's back on a track to profitability. One of the initiatives that come out of the financial raise at Toronto is that over the next call it six to eight months. We'll do a lot more development. We'll increase the grade coming from underground mining increase the tons coming from underground mining. That's going to bring Toronto from about 130,000 ounce producer this year up to 200,000 ounces and that'll be sustained going forward for quite some time. I should mention for both Toronto and for Bibiani, we issued a 43 one on one technical report in off in April, 2023, pardon me April, 2024. We'll be issuing an upgrade next year in April, 2026. Okay. As you would, we expect to see more ounces come into the book and see a longer run rate. And just to remind people the 43 one on one is built off of re reserves only. Okay. Between Toronto and Bibiani, the reserve plus resource is about 6.5 to 7 million ounces. And as I mentioned, we expect to see more ounces coming into the book next April. With that being said, now that there's money in the house, we've already got about 15 or 16 drills mobilized to both sites. Not only to improve grade control and reconciliation, but also to improve the long term outlook. Bibiani and Toronto are located on an 85 kilometer land package. It's about 600 square kilometers. That land package has produced about 8 million ounces in the last 100 years in the next 10 years, we will produce 5 million ounces. And next slide. So you see the run rate here again at Toronto is going to get much more positive. Okay. And for for Bibiani as well. So the consolidated outlook follows both minds. And as you can see by the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter, we're going to be up into the mid 40s in terms of 1000 ounces per month. 2026 production plan has not changed from what we published in, in May this year, it may fit, I think, was the press release. So we're looking next year to produce about 450,000 ounces on the way to 500,000 ounces a year by 2028. I should have mentioned earlier that we are advanced with planning and execution for the underground development at Bibiani. Last week I received a adjudication report on the tender for the development of the infrastructure at Bibiani. That one will be approved over the next call it week. And we expect the successful contractor for mining mine development to be on site late November and start moving some rock in early January. We expect to see the underground development at Bibiani start to produce or toward the fourth quarter next year. And it'll be producing, it'll be producing gold for the foreseeable future internally. We see Bibiani and Toronto running right out to 2040 beyond. David. Okay, we'll stop here very shortly and then it's time for to answer some questions. You're getting too good. That was a quick run through, but now let's, I mean, let's take a deep dive. We, you know, I think that was a great high level run through of what's happening, but, you know, maybe we'll start with the operations. So in the Q two release, you highlighted both Toronto and Bibiani are each expecting to produce 125 to 130,000 ounces for this year. Between the operations, you've produced 80,000 in each one. So I guess the question is what's the main drivers of production growth and how do we get comfort as, you know, heading into each two, you know, as the investor community looks at, you know, kind of that, that big wedge. Production growth. Well, it's, it's a significant change and it's driven from advancement of the rehabilitation of the Bibiani main pit. Okay, the Bibiani main pit, we didn't have the funds, the capital funds to do the stripping that needed to be done. So there's a lot of backlog we've got to get caught up to because that contract has been mobilized now for about eight months. Okay. And because there are a lot of tons have already been moved, we're getting very, very close to what we call the well zone. The well zone's going to carry us right into 2027 and it's the central part of the war body. So we're going to see an average of about 2.4 grams per ton. We're going to see about two to 300,000 ounces per month for that period. So it's, it's a, it's a significant change from what we've been doing previously up to this point. We've seen maybe a hundred thousand ounces, or, pardon me, a hundred thousand tons per month. And maybe in 1.1 1.2 grams. So we're, we're looking at more than double almost triple just from, from the main pit. Russell, as we all know, has been a great benefit to us. We started producing war from Russell. We're now into the second cutback, which gets us into the second horizon of war. So both of those are coming together to make Bibi any very, very productive over the next call it 18 months. And of course, over that period, we'll be bringing the underground mine in the underground mine is going to produce at about 2.7 to 3 grams and about 2.6 million tons per year. Okay. So that takes us out beyond 2030. Along the way, I think people have got used to the idea that we're sitting on a goldfield. We continue to find and develop satellite pits. So we see Bibi any as a 250 to 275,000 ounce producer going well beyond 2030 and toward 2040. I should have mentioned, sorry, the sulfide treatment plant is what makes the Bibi any or bodies viable 30% of the gold that's associated with Bibi any at 100 meters depth or more contained is contained and sulfited about 35 microns. So the sulfide plant is fairly a conventional plant. We make a rougher concentrate. We regrind it to 25 microns. We go through high intensity leach and CIP, along with the knock and reactor. That gets the overall recovery at Bibi any to 92%. Yeah. So just on the sulfide treatment plan, I mean, you just finished there. So why don't we start with the next question on the on the plant. So you talked about going from 60 to 92% recoveries. But I got a question you're asking what when you look at that recovery, what does that mean from a production standpoint? You know, how do we how do we view that going forward just from the plant itself? And then I think there were some talks about optimizing the plant in Q4. I'll just touch on what that looks like and want to implement these earlier. Well, getting them implemented earlier is about money. The plant. We were able to scrape together month by month, about 30 million bucks to get that plant finished. The plant is starting up next week. All the commissioning is is already behind us. We'll run about 12 hours a day for about 10 days or always wrinkles to sort out. And during that period of time, everything will be checked with slurry, not just with water, which has already been done. My experience and I've run a lot of a lot of gold plants. I've run a lot of process plants, I guess. My experience, these things don't happen overnight, but by the time we get toward the end of October, we should be between 85 and 95 or 90% recovery overall. Okay. And then there's going to be tweaks going forward. I mean, I don't expect to sit at 90. I don't expect to sit at 92. Our task work actually showed us getting to 97% recovery, which I think is a stretch. So let's go with a part B to that question because the questions came in online. With the sulfide plant, you know, you talked about getting to a certain area by by October, but how does that trajectory look from a ramp up perspective is it fairly quick to see that transition from 60% to 92 or is that a quarter or quarter. Let me go back to the to the build up here just so that we can visualize it because I think that that helps. Yeah, so, so you know that it's the 80 20 rule. Okay, the first 80% of the benefit will come in the first two months. And then you'll keep, you know, optimizing, evaluating, looking at tank levels, looking at cyanide dosages, looking at recirculating rates with the oxygen reactor, making sure you got control of grind. The last call it 10% from say 82 to 92. That'll happen over a period of, you know, probably a month to a month and a half. Okay. And then forever more you'll fight with that last 2%. Sometimes you'll get it. Sometimes you won't because process plants are always looking at different metallurgical response. On a month over month basis. Got it. So still on the operating side, but more, I guess, revolving around around the country, but there's one question. How are you mitigating potential operating risks such as unexpected equipment failures, power outages or supplies chain disruptions as production ramps into Q2. Let's start with power outages. I think people who have worked with process plants around the world know that. Power outages cause all kinds of damage, all kinds of disruption to the operating plant profile and its performance. We're right now in the middle of completing a generator set. Coming into to be behind it provides about 15 megawatts. So when we lose grid power, the 15 megawatt generator plant will power the whole plant. Downstring right now at Toronto, we have Jens are providing power. This is from a gas turbine. And as a result, Toronto normally scores somewhere between 94 95% plan availability because it's a very, very stable, very, very reliable. We will have Jens are power on site toward the end of the first quarter next year. Okay. So by that time, we won't be relying on the grid. Okay. We'll be relying on Jens, or plus our own auxiliary power. So this is going to be a big game changer actually for Viviani. Yeah. And then just on the supply chain supply chain. A couple of things to think about there is number one. Coincident with getting the money in the door, coincident with getting our service providers fully paid David and the team were able to go to every supplier. And pretty much every supplier subscribe to go from a cash and delivery regime on supply. Now we have for most of our suppliers about 60 days. Okay. So this makes a huge difference. Okay. So we talked a lot about production in the production growth. Now let's flip the switch a little bit to your own staying costs. I mean, obviously the denominator is going to drive a lot of that. But if we look at the numerator, are there any cost cutting initiatives that you think you can undertake now that you have a proper balance sheet? To undergo some of those initiatives. But the principal issue for us with ACIC, excuse me, is stripping. Yeah. So Q four stripping, or pardon me, Q two stripping was about 44. Okay. This quarter, we're looking at around 30 to 35 next quarter. It's getting down to more reasonable numbers like 17. The ACIC going forward is going to follow the path of stripping. That's, that's the biggest single contributor to ACIC at Viviani. At Toronto, we're looking at a lot of development for the next call it quarter or two. And that's going to keep ACIC up around 17 or 18. Life of mine, we see, we see ACIC at both minds. Toronto should be in around 13 to 14. Viviani's going to be in around 12. So we're like, once we've got this capital burden out of the way and these developments out of the way, it's sustaining capital of both minds is not extreme. And ACIC is below 15 for both minds. Got it. Let's see. Sir, another one on, on Ghana. There's a question coming in the line. Can you talk with the area that you're operating in in terms of geopolitical environment and. Obviously there's been some issues in, in West Africa. So just touch on gone as a whole. You know, Ryan, I think, you know, a lot of people have heard me on this. I've worked in Africa about 25 years. For me, Ghana is. The easiest place to work the political regime. Is such that they turn over power peacefully every five years. Okay. The last time there was any kind of a disruption, I think was 1988. There was a coup. So that's what is that 40 years ago. In terms of infrastructure in terms of the people who are available to run your minds. In terms of the service providers big that are available. Ghana is a big mining district has been a big industrial mining district for about 100 years. For me, it's an easy place to work in terms of logistics, the ports work, the customs works. If you want to order a boatload of grinding balls. They'll come out of Spain and they'll be on site in about four weeks. Okay, that doesn't happen where I've worked previously. And I mean, some of the disruptions around West Africa. Have not. Come into Ghana, Ghana has, I think, a very strong and stable military. I think they've got very good security forces and, you know, they're able to close up their borders to some of the. Some of the difficulties that have been elsewhere. So I think the last one on the operations and we'll jump into expiration in the balance sheet. But to finish this off. There's a question on Toronto. So you flag that there's several growth initiatives underway. Can you remind us what those are and what is driving the annual money rate to four million tons per annum. We just dive in deeper on that. So, Toronto, we've done a lot of incremental improvements over the past three years that we've owned it. We've added to the crushing plant. Okay, Toronto right now today is running just less than four million tons a year when we bought the property was running about 3.4. We have revamped the classification circuit and grinding. So we were running at about a 700% circulating load through our grinding plant. Now we're running at 280, which is spot on the pumps have made have been made bigger. The cyclones have been replaced. We've added a rock and reactor and an oxygen plant. So we've got dissolved oxygen now running up at around 20 to 22 parts per million instead of four or five. All of these incremental changes, improve the metallurgical outlook and improve the throughput outlook. The oxygen improves kinetic. I get a little feedback from your line David. Look at that. There we go. Thank you. From an underground mind development standpoint or from an ounce production standpoint. We need to move to live more and more off of the higher grade underground mines that we run. So we're seeing a lot of development needs to go into the underground mines. That includes, you know, refurbishing and replacing a lot of the fleet. Some of the underground equipment at Toronto is now 12 to 15 years. It's just old. It has to be replaced and there's a lot of gear coming into sight as we speak. I spoke the other day with the CEO of. Of a perock, one of our major suppliers. They've got some new equipment coming to sight. There is some new equipment already at site. So we're ramping up at at Toronto to increase grade and increase on the ground tons. So it's not, it's not an effort being placed in a single place. There's several incremental changes that needs. It's nowhere near the capital burden at Bibiani, but it needs about 40 to 50 million all up to be sustainable. About 4 million tons a year and 200,000 ounces a year of production. You just mentioned equipment and it brought me to one of the questions on online here. And this is something that I wasn't aware of, but is the question is, with gone increasingly clamping down an excavator imports. How does a saunty look to be risk any prospective excavator import given your plans of expansion? I haven't heard about clamping down on excavator imports. Are we talking expat? That's a good question. As I mentioned, Ghana has excellent people available to run its mines. It's got a long history of mining. And in fact, when I was CEO of African Barrick Gold, we had four mines. We had three to 400 extra dots. 30% of those came from Ghana. Maybe we'll see the follow up question pop into our chat box here shortly. Okay, so let's move on to exploration quickly. So, I mean, obviously one of the attractive features of a saunty as you have 80 or 85 kilometers of a prospective ground. But the interesting part of that was these two assets operate separately. So since you've consulted them, what have you learned and where are the opportunities that I guess the previous operators wouldn't have seen? Well, the land package that we have incorporates the Toronto shear and the baby Andy shear and they run anywhere from 500 meters to 1.5 kilometers apart for that entire 85 kilometers. The baby and shear contains gold, which has the sulfide issue. And, you know, we've resolved the issue, but up until this point, the people at Toronto thought, well, stay away from it. It's hard. It's hard to process. You know, there's lots of gold along the Toronto shear. So that's how Toronto evolved. At Bibi Annie, Bibi Annie evolved, starting and focused just on the main bit subsequent to our taking ownership. We have found that we're in a gold field. So we see this gold field being available to us up and down. Now, for example, a body, we're opening up now. It's producing oxide or for Toronto mill and it's going to the mill right now. That helps the the profile at the Toronto. But the nice thing about that or body, if you take a look at how it was formed. If you take a look at how the goal is deposited and what the what the mineralized zones look like, you're looking at a strike length. They're about 1.4 kilometers and width of about 400 meters. You're talking grades anywhere to five grams per ton. That's pretty much what the Bibi Annie main bit looked like in 1995 before it started mining. So we're really excited about it. It's on the Toronto lease. We're currently bringing the door to Toronto. But when we get to sulfide, that or we'll go to Bibi Annie. Okay, because we have the sulfide planet. We're in the process of putting a whole road between the two mines. The whole road is expected to be finished in November. So that just opens up a lot of opportunity for bringing different or from different places into either one of the mills, whoever has capacity, whoever has whichever mill has the ability to treat specific. Specific types of war will take care of it. You got a lot of investors sitting on the line and you know investors always like to know when are we getting updates and how is that going to look so you got 15 to 16 rigs. Lots of drilling happening. What's your plan on updating the market on the exploration side of the business. We've got a lot of things happening over the next two weeks and I just went through the messaging plan with with our people the other day. So this week is all about talking about, you know, the second quarter and what does the path forward looks like next week. This TSX week, we're going to be getting on to the TSX. So that's some pretty exciting news. The following week is exploration week. And we'll be talking a little bit more about a bajuabo. We'll be talking a lot about the opportunities that we see at some of our targets for satellite pit development. Okay, we don't ever see ourselves not developing satellite pits. In fact, satellite pits are what kept us alive for the last four years. Okay, they're great opportunities. You can mine quickly. The mining cost because sometimes they don't go that deep. The mining costs are pretty attractive and and satellite pits are, you know, they're, they're going to become our life. I think everybody who's followed the story knows that baby Annie is a goldfield, just like just like Toronto. Yeah. I think you just said it, but there's a question. So let's just clarify. So next week is the TSX venture up list correct. Yes. And then is there a plan to go on to the main board at some point in the future or? Absolutely. Okay. Most of the metrics aside to the company would get us to the big board getting on to the small board is a process that we initiated a couple of years ago. It's advanced. And, you know, we see that we'll be there next week. Got it. And then I saw one just came in on the exploration side. So the question is, what is the spacing of drilling at wild zone and how many tons of grade. Or tons and what's the grade look like what's on the wild zone. Oh, wow zone. Yeah. The wild zone that's essential. Yeah, the sent the wells on the central part of the main pit. We're talking total mining with is about 150 to 200 meters. Okay. We're looking at grades coming out of there on the order of 2.4 grams per ton plus or minus. Got it. And then the exploration side is just, I guess, what are the targets that excite you the most and what could we potentially see from a mine life extension perspective. So I think I talked about a bad, you know, the bad, you know, for us is. Very, very exciting. We see its potential is maybe not a big bit baby any main pit, but it's, it's got some significant potential as a fee to both around and to be any. You know, a bra we talked about abroad started out as a modest mine for us. It had about 350 to 400 meters of strike. That strike now is out over 700, 700 meters. And it looks like it's going to join up with the Sarajevo war body at depth. So we see a bad, you are being a significant long term producer. Something running in around 200 to 2.4 to 2.6 grams per ton. It's obviously open at depth. Pretty much everything in Ghana goes vertical and certainly a bad, you know, doesn't certainly a broad does. We're going to be putting, we take a much longer term view to development of these mines at Toronto. Principally, because we've got gold price north now of $3,000 an ounce, but we'll be putting in an underground transport system, a conveyor to get to surface this allows it to drive these mines. A lot deeper and a lot longer. So a bunch of all is getting bigger. It's going to go deeper than historically. And, you know, a bunch of all was pretty pretty exciting about you all was pretty exciting. Okay, people think that, you know, because Toronto has carried a life of mine for the last 25 years of about 5 to 6 years. Well, we're driving that north internally. Now we see it as about 14 15 years. And I think at some point here, you're going to be asking me a question when you're going to build a bigger plan to when you're going to build another plant. Let's save that for the next webinar. All right, David, let's give you a bit of a break and we'll switch to David Williams for a minute. Let's shift to the balance sheet. So, I guess the first question would just be, obviously, I mean, the big news here was in July and announcing that $500 million package. I mean, it was a, I think it was a long time coming in and certainly was a was a great package that, you know, the market reacted very positively to. So, just first off, David, why don't you give us a quick breakdown of what the pro forma capital structure looks like. And then maybe touch on, you know, how much cash you have in on the balance sheet now and is that sufficient for what the growth plans are heading into 2026. Yeah, absolutely. So I think the word transformative would probably an understatement. If you looked at our July 31 balance sheet, you saw we reported $5 million of cash and we had a working capital deficit of $583 million. So, pretty night and day. So let's go through it. So 500 of cash came in and then there was restructuring on top of that in terms of the Kinross piece. So the financing was comprised of $150 million of commercial bank debt anchored by ran merchant bank out of South Africa, $125 million mezz debt second ranking in the security package. That was anchored by Appian as well as Helicon. And then we have a $50 million stream with Appian as well. And lastly, we did an equity raise that was, and I think Dave, we would be well advised to mention the performance on that by. By the gentleman next to you. We did a bought deal with BMO for $182 million. These guys are rock stars. Okay. We went on a road show with them late May, early June. We got into some very good discussions with solid institutional investors. I think our book closed in about three hours and 21 minutes. So it was a great story all around. And, you know, not only that, but the BMO guys are great to work with. Thank you. We agreed fully agreed. So that's the 500 cash that came in. In addition to that, we owed $175 million to Kinross. We settled that in three different aspects. Firstly, we made them a cash payment of $53 million. Secondly, they received shares at the same price as subscribers in the bought deal for approximately $45 million. And then lastly, they took a convertible to venture for $80 million. That has a seven year maturity. So come to come back to the original question of what the pro form of capital structure looks like. We're looking at about $400 million of leverage going forward. That consists of the 150 of senior debt. 125 of mezz debt. 50 of stream and 80 million convertible to venture due to Kinross. So we're quite happy with how it turned out. We've got extremely strong financing partners at the table working with us. We structured it so that we can achieve this ramp up within a very reasonable period of time before repayment start. And, yeah, we're pretty excited about the way forward in terms of cash on the balance sheet. Now, as Dave mentioned earlier, you know, the primary use of proceeds was to repay creditors and debt. So that happened quickly. And most of the money has been deployed at this point, including to the stripping, finishing off the sulfide treatment plan, the relocation action plan, the equipment replacement program, et cetera. And we are sorry, the last piece of our capital structure that I should mention because it ties in with the question about current liquidity is the fajera gold forward. So that continues to be in place. And we will be making the third draw of $100 million on the fajera facility over the next couple of days. So this is all according to the model. Essentially, our model has always called for from the time of financing until sort of we become free cash flow positive. It's approximately four to five months. Given that we received cash at the end of August, we're looking at sort of end of December before the business as a total. becomes free cash flow positive and we're well financed in terms of liquidity to make ourselves through that period of time. So just a quick follow up. It's funny, you know, in this gold industry, things happen so quickly. And, you know, that that deal literally happened, I think two or three months ago, and it feels like a eternity. But, you know, you said somewhere at the end there, David, and I think you said you got the capital at the end of August. So you can just touch on when it actually closed and when you've had the capital in on your balance sheet because I feel like it's only been two or three weeks. So as the market wants you to push growth, we got to realize that this cash only hit the hit the balance you recently. Yeah, absolutely correct to say end of August. It is I came in tranches through August, but keeping in mind that conditions precedent on the later draws were that overdue creditors and debt payments had to be made out of the first tranches. So essentially what that means for operations is that, and this is all news released. So we had a draw on August 12 August 13 August 15. And then the final draw was towards the 23rd of August on the second draw of the term loan. So the proceeds of the first draws in mid August went towards debt repayment and then the August 23. And we actually drew the revolving credit facility of $20 million on August 29 as well. That is what went to the operation. So, as you can imagine, you know, the money, if we take the August 29th, which I believe was a Friday, I could be wrong. But if you imagine the logistics of receiving the money, you know, actually wiring it within subsidiaries to the right place, getting a swift out getting, you know, into the hands and confirmed on the other side and then being deployed by the other side. You're talking, you know, first week of September. So, and that's fine. We are, we're certainly, you know, positioned well to achieve the ramp up based on that timing of funding. But it is, you know, I think important for investors to understand that, you know, that we're going to really start seeing results towards the end of the third quarter that we're currently in. And then the fourth quarter is looking, obviously, as you can see on the slide, pretty attractive. Yeah, and I think Ryan, you know, you don't just put money in and get an immediate result. Okay. The fact that we were able to mobilize and start stripping months and months ago. The fact that we scraped together 30 million bucks to get the sulfide treatment plant. Those things are now bearing fruit. And with the money that comes in, we were able to get that kind of a curve. That's very, very steep. I don't think anybody would argue with it. But the foundation has been set over the preceding six or eight months. Yeah, I think that's important. You're going. Yeah, I was going to say, Ryan, I think that's important when investors look at the ASIC as well. So we reported a $9,000 ASIC at Bibiani in the second quarter, which is really a meaningless number. And that's because we produced only, you know, 8,000 ounces in the quarter. So of the 130, I'm rounding up a little bit that we're targeting for this year, 80,000. Of the 130,000 that Bibiani comes in the fourth quarter. So, you know, just simple mathematics, you know, a $9,000 ASIC in the second quarter is going to have a very low waiting in the overall ASIC for the year. So we're looking at an ASIC under 2000 for the fourth quarter at at Bibiani, and that's going to get, you know, the ASIC into the range that we've looked at before there. So I just answered part of the question that just popped into the chat box by one of your shareholders. So the question was, can you touch on how the ASIC profile looks in H2? I mean, you just mentioned the Q4, so you don't have to answer that question. But also thinking, you know, as you look at 2026 and 2028, so you're one year out, look at three or look, what does the ASIC look like? And the second part of that question is just around your free cash flow. So can you just kind of give us a sense that when you become free cash positive and what that free cash profile could look like? Yeah. So the third quarter ASIC, you'll continue to see a bit elevated. You'll probably see, you know, over 3000 that each mine. Again, nothing to be alarmed about all according to plan, because it's the fourth quarter when we achieved the throughput recovery and grade profiles of both mines that you see it dipping down to 2000 and below. So for this year, you're looking in sort of the mid 2000s on a consolidated basis in May, we put a figure of 2494 for the year. It's probably going to be trending a bit above that. And that's only because the numerator has come down. And that's just because of the delay in the capital. So all according to plan, we see it being below 3000, but probably be above 2500. And that's again in line with the transition of the profile of the company. You know, just to reiterate in terms of the free cash flow. Generation and the commencement of positive free cash flow. We're looking at likely January of 2026 before the business is free cash flow positive as a whole. And the reason for that is we're obviously ramping up production. We're paying for all of the stripping that's associated with that. And that does impact us through November, December of this year, notwithstanding the high production. And then in 2026, you know, that's when we turn free cash positive and certainly at these gold prices. In terms of, you know, if you look at our five year outlook that we put out in May 5 2025 this year, you're looking at plus $2 billion of free cash generated across both mines. And that's a $3,000 gold and we certainly believe in that profile. If not, if not above that, it's interesting, you know, for disclosure purposes, obviously we're only allowed to put public disclosure based on reserves. And so, you know, people sometimes ask, well, I think we reported $1,000 ASIC in 2029 in that five year outlook. And I don't think it's going to be $1,000. I think it's going to be $13 or $1400. And I think production is going to be $50,000 to $100,000 is higher. So, and we're going to just keep replenishing that. So you may see an update as Dave mentioned with the 43 one ones coming out in April next year. Thank David. And the last question for you on the balance sheet. Is there any covenants or restrictions in the new debt facility that might impact the company's operational and financial flexibility going forward? There certainly are comprehensive covenants that will kick in at the 24 month mark. So we have two years under our facilities to reach what is called project completion. That there are certain production targets and there are certain ASIC targets that we need to achieve within the first two years. And I can tell you that those targets are, well, in the case of production way lower and in the case of ASIC way higher than what we have in our internal plan. So we stay very close with Appian. We stay very close with the technical third party that's been retained by the senior lenders. And everybody's happy at the moment. We're all well on track to achieve those targets. Perfect. So my last few questions are going to be more around strategy and also a little bit on the share price. So here's a fun one coming in online that might make you think a little bit, but the question is what was the magic that helped the share price for the. Basically, why didn't the share price crash when you put out a $4,849 dollar announced ASIC with your Q2? Well, I think, you know, Q2 people look at it already as being in the rear view mirror. I think most people that follow the story know that we've been working for years now to have the funding available to deliver the business plan. The funding is there. The foundation is there, as we mentioned, everybody's mobilized. OK, the sulfide plants ready to go. The miners are ready to go. We're ramping up by the way. Right now we're about 75 trucks working on site by November. We'll have over 100, perhaps 110 trucks working on site. So the haulage for the next six months is very, very significant. And then it starts to tail off in any event. I think people are focused on what's going to happen over the next few months. They know that we've got the funding to do it. And I think most people who are in the story and thank you for your trust. Most people are in the story know that we're going to hit these objectives and produce these ounces and not withstanding. $3,700 gold makes this profile extremely attractive. Yeah. And like I said at the beginning, I mean, listen, I speak with a lot of investors day in and day out and Q2 doesn't matter. Q3 doesn't matter what matters here is a month over month progression. And if you look at the look of this company plus 400,000 ounces, you know, at, you know, sub 17, $1,800. $1,800 million mark cap does not even partially reflect where this can trade. So I think, I think the answer to that is, is the quarters don't matter. There's no other company that trades at a sub billion dollar mark cap that has that production profile and I cost profile. On the simple as that, especially in a $36, $3700 notes. This company now is ready to go. And over the next two quarters, you'll see us delivering our business. Yeah. So this one is on more on strategy. Actually, sorry, I'll get to the hedging one first. I was curious, but this as well. We just have one come in online about the hedging strategy. Do you have any hedges in place? And if so, what price hedging as a CP, I'll leave it there. David. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we do have a hedge book in place. That was a condition precedent to drawing the second draw on the senior facility. So we've structured it as a series of forward sales for approximately half of our production through April of 2026. And thereafter, 100% deferred premium puts on about half of our production through the end of 2027. So what that means in terms of sale price realization between now and April, we will achieve a price of approximately 3386 per ounce on half of our production. We remain unhedged on the other half. And then after April, we were completely unhedged on the upside. So investors get all of the torque to the name. So that was structured carefully. It was designed to maximize the liquidity buffer that we have and improve pricing on the facilities, et cetera. And as you can imagine, commercial banks are quite keen on having at least some over the near term during the ramp up period, some coverage. This one's looking out a little bit because we have a lot on our plate for 25 and 26. But the question is, once you've completed your initiatives at both Bibiani and Toronto. When you look at bolt on acquisitions, are you geographically agnostic or will you look to grow, you know, think on it and do you have a preference to grow organically or in organically. Yes. Sorry. So let's, let's take a look back for a minute. We acquired Toronto in 2022. We looked at two other opportunities before we acquired Toronto and then our ability, because we're centered in Ghana, because we have high end people in our business, we're able to put together a due diligence team. Pretty much on a week's notice. Okay. So if an opportunity comes up, we can be on a site within weeks. We can produce a preliminary report to the board within weeks. And, you know, our ability to move around West Africa, not just Ghana, but our ability to move around West Africa is immediate. Okay. So is Ghana something we see in terms of an M and A opportunity? Absolutely. Is our other jurisdictions. Not the famous ones right now, but our other jurisdictions of interest to us. Absolutely. Okay. There's places that that I don't personally want to go. There's places that I don't want to take the company, but there's other places that we can go and operate quite easily from from a crop and from Ghana. Maybe just to expand upon that. We don't have a big office in in a crop. We have 25, 30 people in a crop doing, you know, legal and government affairs and things are talented people or our technical people are on the mind sites where they can add value immediately. And that's, that's pretty much how we run the company. Got it. And this is, this will be my last question. It goes back to the share price a little bit. You got a lot of shareholders watching on the line right now. So in your view, what's the, what's the best way to rewrite your valuation to trade more in line with peers. Hit the marks in November, December and January and you'll see a totally different story. Yeah. Okay. Look, we spent three years now more than three years and David's been with the company more than two years putting together this financial initiative. And while we've been doing that, we've always said, this is how the profile will look when we get money. And that story really hasn't changed. We've just been keeping the business going, but looking for the, the financing to come in and clean things up and give us a path forward. That's now in place. Okay. Nobody can say, well, they're still looking for money. We're not planning to do any more raises or anything like that. The money's in hand, the planning is well understood. There's nothing about this business plan that is what I consider high risk. Okay, it's conventional mining. It's conventional processing and it's, and it's production of a lot of gold from two assets. So there's a lot to build on here, but I think the rewrite comes in December and January when people recognize that this is no longer a 200,000 ounce of your company. This is now a company that will hit its 2026 targets and it's viability of 450 to 500,000 ounce company. And that's, that's just a different look. Yeah. All right. So that's the end of the questions that we have. So with that, is there anything that we missed or is there any closing remarks you want to make? Well, we sell to shareholders on the line. Well, I don't know that. I mean, it's pretty comprehensive discussion. David mentioned some of our principal partners. RMB has stuck with us almost 18 months while we put everything else together. Okay, be most been a great, a great partner throughout the, the equity side and getting the raise completed and I think people know that you can raise the, you can get strong indications on the debt. But if you don't have the equity there to support it, the whole package doesn't happen. So that was fantastic. Appian is our partner obviously on the debt and equity side. And then, of course, we've got some great business partners. Okay. Pw mining is very, very well known. It's a tier one mining contractor. FLS has been, you know, the provider for the sulfide treatment plant. We're looking forward to seeing that plant going. But, you know, there's a lot of partners in Ghana who have stayed with us. We've extended a lot of companies and finally paid off their trust in us. And, you know, we're totally grateful for that support. Excellent. Well, listen, with that, thank you so much, David and David for joining us. And thank you everyone for joining us today on the line. We really appreciate the time. Thanks. Thanks.
