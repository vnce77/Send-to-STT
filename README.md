Let me quickly talk about the private equity market in general, and Puyo's Partners Group holding is a public company, and that was the former CFO. I know both worlds pretty well, private equity and public equity. So I would like to compare public markets with private markets, but I'm preaching my own gospel here, because I will be quick, because the fact that you dialed into this call already shows that you're a believer in private markets. I will then explain the parts of investment approach, and in that context, closing with an illustrative example. Last year, 2023 has seen extremely low exit activity. And although compliance keeps repeating that past performance is no indicator for future performance, it is often very helpful to look back at the history to understand future. And if you look back the last 30 years, Partners Group was founded in 1996. And since then, the world experienced several ups and down market cycles. And guess what? After bull market follows the bear market, and after follows the bull market again. For example, 1995 to 1998, we all remember the dot-com bubble, great exit activities for the private equity industry. Then 2021, 2002 dot-com bubble burst it, record low exit activities. But in 2004, 2006, great recovery. Lot of exits and followed by global financial crisis correction, 2007 and 2008, low exit activity. Then great recovery in 2011 to normal, back until 2018, then COVID-19 hit. But then followed the high 2021. And as always, after high comes low and those 2023 was low. So the good news is that a trough means the future will be brighter. So I don't have to crystal ball, but if you look at the first half of 2024 on the next slide in page nine, then you see that in age one, 2024, we already have seen an improvement in exit activity. But this year's on track to be more of a normal exit activity year, meaning in line with 2018 and 2020 levels. And so we have seen there are cycles, but there's also trend. And if you look at the trend on page 10, the private equity industry is clearly showing upwards. So private equity assets and the management had tripled the last 10 years from the three trillion to 10 trillion US dollars. And it's estimated to double again, the next 10 to 15 years from 10 trillion to 20 trillion. And the real economy is happening in private markets, not in public markets. For example, in the US, 87% of companies with more than 100 million revenues are private. So that means that the private equity industry in the US alone has more than 20,000 companies to choose from, whereas the public market investors can only choose from less than 3,000 public companies. And the trend in public markets is negative. Look at the number of IPOs, for example, the 20 years, 1980 to 2000, sick and a half thousand IPOs, versus the 20 years, 2000, 2021, only 3,000 IPOs, so less than half. And even those companies which are public, they sell subsidiaries which they believe are non-strategic. And these are estimated to amount to 10 to 15 billion. And of course, the divestment of a public company means an investment for private equity company. And in page 11, not only the number of new IPOs are declining, also the number of public companies which are public are declining. So today the world has half the number of public companies than 25 years ago. For example, in the US, a fall from 8,600 to 4,300 companies be in public. And the industry has changed too. So IT companies in 2010 made up 20% of public market caps, versus today over 40%. So does IT's increasing, but normal industries like industrials, energy and financials are declining, innovating public markets? And we all have noticed the dominance of the famous Magnificent Seven in public stocks in the MSCI World Index the last 12 months, to a point where the MSCI World Index is not representing any more normal private equity companies, I believe. So what's the future will be? On page 12, we distinguish the inactive and passive approach. And in public markets, I have to say, the asset management industry has changed dramatically. I mean, in the past, highly experienced portfolio managers were paid to outperform a benchmark alpha for being active. That was the key success is being active. But nowadays more and more investors give them only two passive index funds. And the few remaining active funds force their portfolio managers to minimize the tracking error to a benchmark because of risk management reasons, which of course leads to performance of these funds being more and more beta. We also see a similar development in private markets too. But private markets work totally differently. When a private equity manager buys one company, nobody else can buy the same company. So BlackRock, for example, cannot come and buy 1% of each private equity company, make an eye-share ETF index out of it at low cost. In private equity, the closest to an index fund is maybe a fumber fund, where the manager tries to replicate beta by committing to as many private equity managers as possible. But we at Portland School, we believe we need to be active. We need to find alpha, not beta. And in private equity, you need to work hard to create value. You buy a majority stake. So you need to take the lead to the business as an owner. You need to have active stewardship. You need to be an entrepreneur. And on page 13, we use the word transformational investing at Portland School. And what do we mean by this, is that we don't want to buy a company to increase sales or see only marginally by, for example, 10% or reduce cost by 10%. No, we want to double or triple the EBITDA during our holding period. And if it would aim for only marginal improvements, we would call it marginal investor or something like that. But we want the improvement during the years of our holding period being substantial hence the term transformational. And how do we try to achieve this? So on the one hand, the process, have we find the new attractive investment opportunities is very systematic. We do deep dives into sub-sectors of each industry to find high conviction targets. And once we have invested in a company, we run the business as entrepreneurs, meaning entrepreneurial governance, meaning value creation through platform building and asset transformation. And on page 14 gives you more color on these two boxes. On the left hand side, entrepreneurial ownership means that we find the best possible board members and we want them to be active. Meaning, for example, minimum one day per week that they need to spend working on this company and they need to take full responsibility for one important value creation driver, for example, bringing a US company to Europe or M on day growth or whatever it is. They need to have a five to 10 year vision. And now in part of the group, you know, we are interested in hard data. That means not just the marketing blah, blah, but board members are measured by clear KPIs with annual board assessment reviews. And we even have a proprietary software for this, which we call PG Alpha. And on the right hand side, examples of transformational levers, which drive EBITDA growth or digital transformation, new products, new regions, platform building, complemented by pricing excellence and operational efficiency improvements. So I'm also a three slide that we'd like to spend on a key study about diversity tech, which is a very successful HVAC company in the US and HVACA or stands for Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning. Does diversity tech makes money on installing, maintaining and repairing air conditioning devices, which cannot only cool in summer, but also can heat and winter. Part of this group runs this business as entrepreneurs to drive fundamental value creation and develop the systematic operational value creation playbook to drive growth and profitability improvements. On page 16, you see that diversity tech has increased their revenues by 30% to 0.9 billion US dollars during our holding period, which is basically the last two years. It is a complex business with over 300,000 orders for field per annum, because customer can choose from 30,000 different parts from diversity tech. The reverse deck has done 18 acquisitions since 2015, and reading all the private equity managers' reports, every company they buy is always a leader, but he is actually really true. The reverse deck is a top five of its seven product categories. A typical example of value creation is bringing a successful US company to Europe. This does not always work, because for example, culture differences, but it works surprisingly often. For example, the French are well known for the cuisine, the art of fine dining, but who would have thought that the largest European McDonald's hop with over 1,500 McDonald's locations is France? So the reverse deck managed to increase the number of subsidiaries in Europe selling air conditionings and maintaining them and repairing them from one to six subsidiaries in the last two years, and all of them now know how to disclose the revenues of the European business. I managed to get the proof to mention that the EBITDA of European business has grown by six times the last two years, and because of this, the share of European business as present in the total business has grown from less than 5% to 20%. With this, I would like to hand over to Federica to talk about the portfolio performance of PGP Limited. Thank you, Cyril, and good morning, everyone. I'll take it from here and provide an update on portfolio development over the first half of 2024, as well as an outlook on portfolio activity. We'll start here with a slide that you should be familiar with, one that recouped PGP Limited's portfolio composition, which is really designed to reflect the company's goal, meaning to provide access to a high quality portfolio of direct private equity investments with broad sector and geographic diversification. I will not go into the details of every single chart or names here, but I will take a moment to highlight key changes to portfolio composition versus last quarter. First of all, the percentage of portfolio NAB in direct private equity investment continues to take up any current list ends at 97%. The exit of SRS distribution also changed the sector and regional split of the portfolio and the margin. And now we have a more balanced sector split between healthcare and industrial versus last quarter, as well as a more balanced split in regions between Western Europe and North America versus the previous overweight to the US. SRS was also the portfolio's second largest position at the end of Q1, and this exit changed the composition of our top 10 portfolio companies that you see here on the right-hand side of this slide. At the same time, strong performance from International Schools Partnership and Galderma means that these two companies entered top 10 following positive revaluations during the quarter. Well, there has been some turnover in the top 10 names. There have been no meaningful changes in the share of the portfolio these companies represent, and you'll see that our top five are stable at just around 30% of overall NAB. As familiar, as many of you might be with our top 10 positions, it is worth highlighting that BGP limited portfolio as much more depth to it in terms of single name diversification. With over 70 portfolio companies across our four PG thematic verticals and an average position size of 1.5%, the portfolio does not rely on just the handful of assets to drive performance. The number of positions alone, however, does not fully capture concentration risk. The size of each individual position is also a critical variable that determines overall portfolio risk and return. We try to depict this graphically here on this slide where each square in the puzzle represents a portfolio company, and the size of the square approximates the represented NAB share of each asset. As a portfolio manager, my goal in portfolio construction is to proactively manage the size of the position in line with available liquidity, as well as investment flow, remaining mindful of concentration risk, and at the same time of over diversification. Finally, before moving on, I'll find a word on sector diversification. Academic literature, but also maybe common sense, see strong value in sector diversification in public market portfolios, but this might not always be in the case in private markets. Due to the very nature of private market investments, which relies on active engagement with portfolio companies to generate performance through bottom up value creation, evidence suggests that managers who leverage their specific skills and expertise, focusing their efforts on fewer sectors or themes, demonstrate better outcomes and performance. In a partners group, we embrace this approach, but we do so by investing through a thematic lens across four industry verticals, technology, goods and products, health and life and services. And here you see these four sectors and verticals represented by four different colors on the chart. On the next page, I will just touch quickly on what we consider to be our return engine, that's how we call it here, and that's the balance vintage year diversification. You might recall this slide from previous updates, but I really cannot overemphasize the importance of steady deployment to spread risk across macro and market environments, but also to sustain portfolio liquidity over time. We'll return to the vintage year's topic later on in the call, and I will therefore leave these slides for now for you to take in. But the one point I highlight is really the almost perfect 50-50 split between mature assets in the portfolio and younger assets, indicated strong support for both upcoming portfolio liquidity, but also for continued value creation. As we continue again to on value creation, I'll take a moment to highlight two recent investment examples that illustrate different ways in which partners group design and execute value creation plan. In the first case, it is about building an international platform through strategic acquisition. Well, in the second case, it is about continuing to accelerate strong organic growth in what's already a widely recognized leader in its market segments. We'll talk about pest control partnership, an investment that came into the portfolio during the first half of 2024, and represents partners group plan to establish a proprietary buy and build leading international platform in a 22-billion year global pest control sector. With pest control partnership, we aim to replicate the successful playbook that we've employed in building out other platforms such as the International School Partners by anchoring value creation around three steps. First, acquire small, profitable, independently owned operators at a creative multiple. Then integrate the acquired targets into a platform to drive operational efficiency, building density, and care. And finally, leverage technology to further enhance service delivery and back office efficiency while improving the quality of customer service. As risks posed by pests in commercial and industrial setting, increase as a result of structural trends such as urbanization, globalization, and climate change. Pest control partnership targets to offer traditional and technology enabled services to address these challenges. Services such as integrated pest management, food safety and oil team are crucial for businesses and organizations where pest issues can have a significant impact on productivity, product quality, health and safety, and regulatory compliance. With thousands of potential targets in Europe alone and over 10 already in exclusivity, pest control partnership management team is already actively working to deliver on our ambitious value creation plan. More recently, in July 2024, partners group agreed to acquire a majority stake in Fair Journey Biologics, a leading antibody discovery contract research organization, trusted partner of leading farm and biotech company. This is a company that primarily focuses on discovering development of antibody-based therapy. Our investment team tracked the assets since early 2022 for over two years, and initiated detailed commercial due diligence in 2023. Over time, we built a strong relationship with Fair Journey CEO and founder, while also engaging with the majority shareholder, GHO Capital, which ultimately positioned us as the preferred owner to steward the company through its next phase of growth. Partners group will work with CEO and founder, who will remain a significant shareholder, and its management team to drive strong growth while identifying add-ons of complementary capabilities and technologies to unlock faster, more effective drug development for good journey partners. This transaction is expected to close in the coming week, formally entering PGP-limited portfolio in Q3 2024. I'm very pleased to add these two assets to the portfolio, as two foundational businesses that provide proven scalable solutions to address significant challenges facing our environment and our society. On the next slide, we see how our investment teams continue to build a solid pipeline of the investment opportunities to support deployment. These are automatically sourced across our verticals, and then regarded the screen by our global investment committee. Just earlier this week, in the middle of summer, really, four brand new opportunities were presented to our IT for the first time. The ones you see here are already more advanced opportunities which have been through the first round of your diligence screening, and we might indeed see some of them coming into the portfolio down the line. There's no need to go into the details of every company here, but please do notice how these names are spread to cover various sectors, countries, enterprise size, and also end market. All these assets have one thing in common. If you came through the short description, you'll note how most of these companies are the leaders in their respective market segment, consistent with our approach to focus on market leading companies that we see as best positions to capitalize on their market share and reputation to further grow to withstand market challenges and to protect margins and profitability. Investing in market leaders or transforming companies into ones will also help positions such companies for successful exits. And as we spend a moment to update you on ongoing monetization and a coming exit processes, it is no coincidence that the names in focus are recognized leaders in their market. Starting here from SRS distribution, Andrea has already mentioned the receipts of full proceeds from the sale of this company to Home Depot, Simon Q1. Last quarter, we conservatively indicated the transaction was likely to close to the end of the year, but in fact, we received 17 million euros in June 2024 and it were used to pay down our outstanding credit facility. Together with the 13 million euros received from SRS distribution during the life of the investment until Q1, 2024, this translated into Realize Gross multiple in excess of five times money. Another worthy update here is on Galderma. The stock price of the company is up 25% approximately since IPO earlier this year, now implying an enterprise value in excess of $20 billion. Most importantly, the six month lock up and share period is due to expire at the end of September. And a gradual sell down of our stock could potentially commence earlier in Q3, following the acquisition of a 10% stake in the company by LRL. Finally, a word on Avasthenan's here, possibly a less well known and certainly smaller company. Avast is a leading financial company that primarily focused on unbanked and informal income segments of home buyers in India. We invested in Avasthen 2016 in what was at the time the largest financial services buyout in India. Under our ownership, the company grew into a scale business thanks to a number of strategic initiatives around product and regional expansion, but also business digitalization and management upgrades. We ideal the company two years later in 2018 and gradually sold down our stake between 2020 and 2024, already realizing a DPI of over three times at the end of June. What's new here is that we recently signed an agreement for a final stake sale to CVC capital. This is subject to customary approval and expected to close in the next six months, leading to an expected growth to DPI for this investment in excess of five times. In line with the overall company size, a PGP is limited position in Avast is relatively small in the context of the portfolio and will not be a needle mover from a liquidity perspective. However, I do think that this investment is not worthy as a testament to our ability to realize value across business sites, regions and also different exit avenues. So here we have the elite of three companies, where we've seen recent meaningful development towards either full or partial realization, but our confidence in portfolio liquidity is more broadly supported by the overall positive momentum within an exit over the past 12 months, as well as by the ongoing processes that involve more than 10 companies in our portfolio at the moment, which we look forward to updating you on in future quarters. Moving on to performance, I'm pleased to report that the company's portfolio is exactly, is doing exactly what it does on the team. That is providing access to a private equity portfolio, whose returns are driven by operational value creation in direct investment, where partners group transformational ownership approach is central to unlock that's return. Graspal portfolio performance for the first half of the year was 4.8%, which is what you see in dark brown bars in both charts here on the slide. On the left hand side, we decompose the return by breaking it down by asset type, and we can see how this is almost exclusively driven by direct investment and primarily a private equity one. Notably the sales of SRS distribution at over 30% uplift to the company's prior valuation, provided the largest contribution. But among starter meaningful drivers, I'd like to highlight PCI Pharma, the portfolio's largest holding of today. Since our initial investment in 2016, PCI has achieved any BTA K or over 20%, and continues to outperform expectations, surpassing our initial 2020-2016 underwriting assumption. The company continues to surpass also revised projections from 2020, when we partially realized our investment selling part of the equity, while continuing to actively contribute to the value creation through our two board seats. On the right hand side, we instead decompose the portfolio return by financial metrics. The results show that E-B-D-A growth, that the value creation at the operational level within our portfolio company, is the main driver of performance, and clearly so. Increase in E-B-D-A multiple also contributed positively to total value creation, and so did portfolio changes, mainly represented by the SRS exit and the early positive performance of our new asset development care. These positive effects were only partially offset by an increase in debt at the portfolio company level, as we took the opportunity to refine some debt packages at lower spread, to strengthen capital structures, to sustain growth and platform building plans for our companies during the period. On the following page, we have a snapshot of portfolio E-B-D-A broken down by TDPI marks, which can be seen as an indication of value creation initiatives being reflected in portfolio company value. There have been no material changes here versus previous quarter, and over 90% of our E-B remains marked above cost, resulting in an N-A-V waiting money multiple just under 2.2 times. If we exclude assets whose performance is too early, really to be assessed against our plan, over 60% of portfolio N-A-V is outperforming our base case on the writing plan, and a further 30% are on plan with our on the writing plan, with less than 10% N-A-V falling below our expectations. As mentioned last time, underperforming assets represent a limited and contained set of investments, whose negative news has been largely reflected in portfolio already, and we do not see them significantly impacting performance going forward. Indeed, there were no changes in this component of the portfolio, which remains stable, limited and well monitored. On the right side, instead, we notice a clear color relation between the holding period of our assets and their valuation mark, suggested that we continue to compound growth towards, sorry, throughout our holding period, all the way through realization. And we explore these aspects in a bit more detail on the next slide, where I break down portfolio N-A-V by marks and by the integer. It is a very dense slide, and while you'll see a lot of red figures in here, there's nothing to be alarmed about. In Partners Group recent rebranding, red is the color we used to highlight positive aspects and key takeaways. Let me then use the four boxes on the top right here to help me guide you through the main summary point. First, four and a half years is the average holding period for companies in our portfolio today. This figure is approximately half a year higher than it was two years ago, as macro backdrop as a result in low transaction volume within the market and longer holding period. This extension of holding period has somewhat weighed on portfolio IRR, a metric that is influenced by the timing of cash flow. And it has danced to, especially in 2022 and 2023, when many of the assets we invested in pre-2019 would have normally reached their maturity. In this mindset environment, however, we remain disciplined, held on to our assets, and decided to sell when the time is right, continuing to compound performance as they approached or even surpassed in certain cases our target holding period of five to six years, as you see in the second box. The question then becomes, how are our pre-2019 assets performing? Are they going to drive future performance? To answer, I'll move to the bottom boxes. First, 50% of our NAB is in companies we've been holding for over four years. And some of these are our best performing assets, and recent performance drivers are included in these clusters. Think PCI pharma again, Aida's financier, Aida's keen their care. As you can see from the red area in the two left bars in the chart, these assets are largely held at a multiple that is in excess of two times investment. However, the last figures show us that the way multiple we've realized on last 12 months exits stands higher than two times at around three times by multiple. This is also very much in line with the multiple we've achieved for pre-2019 assets that we have already solved to date, including, for example, the recent sale of SRS at an uplift of over 30%. In summary, to bring it all together, our more mature companies are performing well, and the majority of them have been preparing for exits. While I must say that past performance is not indicative of future results, we do take comfort in our realized record and are encouraged by recent transactions like SRS, Engelderma, indicated that our mature assets retain upside potential, also at exit. I will now hand you over back to Andrea to summarize discussion points before opening up for Q&A. Thank you, Federica, for this very comprehensive presentation. Now, let's take a moment also on this slide, which shows the consistent performance across cycles of partners through private equity limited. So the company's investment objective is focused on delivering long-term capital growth and an attractive dividend yield. Over the last 10 years, we've achieved double-digit annual returns for both share price total return and not total return, showcasing our commitment to creating long-term value. This consistent performance across market cycles reinforces our dedication to delivering sustained growth and our year-to-date results further underscored this with a healthy 4.1% year to date an off total return. Or over. The dividends paid out over the last 12 months have yielded 6.3% based on June's closing price, aligning with our objective of providing an attractive dividend yield for our investors. Now, before we move on to the Q&A, I would like to lead you with the following points. PGPE Limited provides shareholders with exposure to partners, groups, direct private equity investment strategy. Participating in transactions alongside some of the world's largest institutional investors. Partners Group is a thematic investor. Focusing on investments in companies where growth is underpinned by long-term transformative trends. Now, PGPE LTD portfolio demonstrates diversification, providing investors exposure to companies operating in a variety of industries and jurisdictions. The portfolio was built over time, achieving a very good vintage diversification. We have an attractive mix of mature assets, but also assets that are newer in value creation stage, and that gives a consistent performance across market cycles. From an investment perspective, we continue to focus on the discipline deployment of capital and the identification of companies where we believe we can support management to create value. We believe that the current discount enough offers value and provides exposure to well-diversified global private equity portfolio that continues to generate positive enough performance. And finally, as already mentioned, the company's investment objective is to generate long-term capital growth and an attractive dividend. And it has achieved double-digit now and share price total return performance over the last decade. With this, we conclude the update, and at this point, we are happy to open for the Q&A. I see we already have a number of questions in the webcast, and as already mentioned earlier, we will group similar questions and answer in one go. I already have a first question here. For you, Cyril, could you please talk more about how you source yields? Yeah, of course. And that is a simple question, but a very long answer, but that tried to make it short. So we are doing thematic sourcing, so that means we have five of the ostrichs, we have goods and products, health and life, technology and services. We have 200 full-time employees who do nothing else, but sourcing investment. So it's one of the largest in-house teams across the globe, and we're looking for established business models of meaningful margins, experienced strong management, which are positioned for growth. These are the criteria. And we source about half of the investments which we source is from our integrated platform, and the other half from our internal network. But the key thing is that on average, from a thematic source research to sourcing, it's more than two years of preparation. So it's a very long time, and the idea is to be proactive, to try to identify those companies which we want to own, and then approach the owner, actually before there is a sale going on, so one or two or three years before there is a sale intended, approach the owner and say, hey, you have a great business, we would like to buy this business from you. Thank you, Cyril. Okay, now I see also a question for you, Federica. In the report, you state that you have 125 million of unfunded commitments. Could you provide some comments around what these are? Yes, absolutely. So of the 125 million unfunded commitment represent everything that we are sort of legally bound to unfound. So we are very conservative in estimating this figure. 35 million out of this 125 are pre-2015 commitments, mostly unfunded commitments to fund holdings that are largely now in harvesting phase. And so we really consider this extremely unlikely to fund. Of the remaining 90 million, approximately a third is undrawn from direct investment that we have made within the portfolio, and we expect these to draw over the next few years, as our companies continue to build and grow. And then we also have approximately 50 million of unfunded commitments to active partners group flagship private equity funds. And again, here we expect approximately 90% of these will be called in line with the typical coal level of primary funds. So out of the overall 125 million figures, I would guide towards approximately 80 million unfunded commitments expected to be called over the next two to four years. Thank you, Federica. I also see that we have a number of questions around the ethics management in the portfolio. Could you give us more color on that? Yeah, sure. You might remember that we discontinued our effects hedging policy early in 2023, and since then we are not actively hedging the effects exposure of the portfolio. Having said that, we do report on a monthly basis. In our monthly report, the effects, the currency breakdown of the portfolio for investors that wish to hedge their currency risk on their side. Thank you. Okay, now I have a question for you as well. Do you have any numbers on portfolio company, beta or revenue growth across portfolio? Anything regarding the margin? Even the focus on value creation? Yeah, I'm actually a little bit disappointed to have several of you asking this question because we spend so much love the last couple of months to develop page 26, 27, 28, the presentation which we believe are better positioned to actually explain the performance and how much came from EBITDA or how much what came from EBITDA multiples, how much came from net debt. So the short answer is the following. The average EBITDA growth last month as of June is 9%. The EBITDA multiple is 17 times and the net debt in percent of EBITDA is 35%. Now, the longer answer to this is how you calculate this and I think you all know that I have written my PhD thesis in private equity elevations, but I think my publication for my professor, I will write on this topic because I realize it's actually not so simple. So for example, what you do with public companies like Galdermo, which the elevations are not made using EBITDA, but they're actually, you lose the share price or what about infrastructure companies like Accentio, which are not valid at EBITDA, but they are using the discounted cash flow model, or what about accepted companies as SRS distribution, where we don't use EBITDA multiples anymore, but we just use the exit price. Or what about new companies which entered in H1 2024, we were not there last year, or exits of last year, which are not there anymore this year. So you never have a real good like to like comparison if you calculate an average, and even if you calculate an average, how you calculate an average, simple average, anyway, the average, beginning of the year, end of year, average period. So what we have done here in these figures, which I announced, we have taken the average enemy as of the end of the year, end of June, divided by two, and we have used 51 companies, which represent, represented 91% of NAF as of June, and we have excluded the public companies like all the NAF, we have excluded the infrastructure companies like Accentio, we have excluded the exited companies like SRS distribution, and if you ask the question about EBITDA, also there we dig into the numbers more deeply, what we included is actually their closed EBITDA transactions, but not the performer kind of expected to close EBITDA transactions in these figures. But I believe it's always a snapshot as of a certain date, as of December, as of June, so it's not the best to actually try to understand the performance of the portfolio. Thank you, Cyril. Now, we also have a couple of questions around the liquidity and also share buybacks in light of the capital allocation policy. And, I mean, as I already presented right earlier during the webcast, I mean, the capital allocation policy respects the liquidity position and waterfall of the company, as such, the dividend, as well as ongoing fees, expenses, repayment of outstanding in-depthness, and the reserve to meet existing investment commitments will be provided for prior to excess free cash flow being used for share buybacks according to the mechanism which was described as we start to see more exits and distributions. It is expected that free cash flow will turn positive and then, depending on the share price to not discount, surplus cash flow would be available for buybacks. Now, I have another question for you, Federica. Now, the report and presentation don't hold any information around portfolio level debt. Would you provide some insights on this? Yes, assuming that portfolio level that means the use of credit facility. We closed the first half of the year with no drawn facility within the portfolio. As I mentioned, we used proceeds from, I received from SRS distribution sales to fully repay our outstanding facility, which previously sent at approximately 40 million euros. As of today, also, we remain fully and drawn on the facility. Going forward, I would indicate we will continue to use the facility as always to really bridge short-term mismatches between cash inflows and outflows and again staying around the 0-5% of any of the in terms of utility utilization, which is what we've been consistently doing for the past years. Thank you, Federica. Now, I see a couple of other questions. One of them back again to maybe to the ethics right and to the exposure. Why did your currency exposure change in June? Yeah, I mean, I touched on the portfolio changes when covering the diversification slide. The exit of SRS, which represented approximately 7% of the portfolio, did change the regional composition of our portfolio and also the currency exposure. So that's really what was the driver there. The balance between dollar and euro currency exposure within the portfolio shifted around. So we are now currently standing at approximately 47% euro, while beforehand we had 47% dollars without really the SRS exit was the main driver there. Thank you very much. Now one last question before we close with the Q&A. And actually, I think this one is still for you, Federica. So are you underweight on technology as a sector? Well, already the turn underweight means that we're implying the use of a benchmark, right? So I guess this comes from a perspective of someone looking at us versus, for example, the MSCI world, where as Sierra mentioned, the technology exposure is closer to 40% of the index. So yes, we are underweight technology versus the MSCI world. But one could also argue that the MSCI world is overweight technology sector as a whole. So what I would say is that we respect really our goal, which is to be aligned with partners group platform, and we do our in terms of our exposure to IT. And we're also very much aligned with the small cap public equity investment universe, which has only approximately 11% in their technology exposure. Perhaps what I close to point out is that we had very successful realizations in our IT portfolio. I think in global logic, FBI global, or even Civica more recently. This also means that our technology segment in the portfolio is newer, is younger, right? So potentially, yes, to grow into their valuation in terms of size. So over time, as these newer assets grow in value and size, and we continue to add new ones, by the way, I would potentially expect the technology exposure to increase at the margin, but I would still see this at around 15 to 20% of portfolio, probably not reaching the values for, again, indices such as the MSCI world as they are today. Thank you. Thank you, Federica, very much for this. With this, we will conclude the webcast today. We would like to thank you all for joining the webcast, and we wish you a wonderful day ahead. Have a lovely day.
