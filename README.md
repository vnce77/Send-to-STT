Hi welcome back everyone. So, I'd like to introduce the next guest, Denny Ricard, President and Chief Executive Officer of IA Financial. Thank you for joining us. You're welcome. Nice to have you here. And I thought we could maybe start on the first half just because it was such a really strong performance pretty much across the board and obviously some you know even more outsized performance in Q2 on the experience gains. Maybe that comes off a bit but probably a lot of areas that are going to stay strong in the second half. Maybe talk about that dynamic to start with. Sure. How H2 is sort of shaping up. Yeah obviously we were very proud of the results of Q2 and in fact for the full I mean so far for the half of the year. I would say I call the Q2 results exceptional in a sense that all our sectors really pushed on the same direction. Significant experience gains in all the sectors. Usually you'd find you know one sector having some variability on the negative side and then the others would offset but this time it's been quite exceptional because they all went in the same direction. But at the end of the day probably some of it will be will stay over the long term. We are executing on our strategy very very carefully and I invite those of you who have not attended the February investor event to listen to it. It's online because we are basically describing the recipe of success of IE using what we call the IE way and we might go into that later on. I might talk about some of the elements but we are executing on our strategy. We try to be really focused on what we're doing and so I quite I feel quite confident that it will continue going forward. Okay maybe dovetail into the ROE. Obviously you're already at that 17% target for 2027 on a trillion 12 month basis. You sort of blew past it in Q2. Any thoughts on that? I'm not going to try to pin you on a new guidance or anything like that but I'm sure you're looking at it thinking if we get continued momentum here in most of our businesses. Yeah let's not forget that the guidance is 17% plus. Very good point. So we probably are working on the plus side right now assuming that the macroeconomic environment stays favorable as it is right now. We feel quite confident that we can generate the type of ROE that we've produced recently. So we we're focusing on the plus. Now let's let's keep something in mind here. We want to grow as an organization. We have excess capital. We want to deploy that capital. Our last choice of deployment is just to buy back shares. Okay so we are obviously investing in our current businesses organically but also we're looking at opportunities in organically. So if we if we are in faith let's say we are in faith we are facing a situation where we are looking at the business that is really let's say complementary to what we're doing you know fits very well and with our strategy and we can get it at the price which lead to a I don't know 15% or we guess what we'll do it okay we'll do it. So keep in mind that the 70% is a kind of a obviously what we are currently producing and what is going to take for us to grow going forward. So it might be that at some point we are investing in in organization with an our we which I think will will make us grow going forward. So for us it's really the idea is to grow the business and that's why we are prudent in saying that it's 17 plus. If we don't find an opportunity that is let's say sizable going forward because we're generating thanks so much capital. Yes we will deploy capital by buying back shares going forward and it might go that the ROE is going a bit higher but it's not our end game to be at 18 19 or 20% or we it's 17 percent for us. We believe this is satisfactory for our shareholders. Okay and maybe maybe talk about obviously you're very focused on the ROE. You're also very proud of the historical performance on the book value per share growth. That's been a pretty pretty amazing trajectory versus industry versus your peers just the broader market. Maybe talk a bit about that dynamic. Yeah I mean we are in a long-term business and I find that the best indicator of performance in the long-term, forget about the stock price for the moment, I mean internally is really the book value growth. Because book value grows over time or over a long period and compasses all the noises that you can hear from one quarter to the other, volatility in the market, adjustments to the reported earnings. When you look at the book value it includes everything when you think about that. So yes you're right I mean when I look at historically and even over the last year with the last year we've grown it by 9% which is way above anything you find in our industry. But when you look at it on a long-term basis which is even more important, again we have grown it much more significantly than the whole industry. Okay and you touched on the economy, the macroeconomic environment will obviously drive what happens in the second half. Maybe just touch on your thoughts, anything you wanted to point to, how does it inform your decision making and any specific business lines that maybe stand out in a good way or a bad way given what you see now with the macroeconomic. Well the macroeconomic environment right now is positive because two things the market stock market is pretty good. So it fuels our wealth management business as an example. It is also very positive on the individual insurance business because some of the asset is invested in an all-term in stocks. But we also listen also at the interest rates, long-term interest rates are up. For us it's good. We benefit from let's see a positive slope of the yield curve and specifically specifically if the long-term interest rate is going up. So right now we are in a very very good spot and this year I mean the long-term interest rates in Canada and the US have gone up significantly and it's been positive for us. And so your outlook sounds constructive, you know, currently constructive and anything you see in the horizon that might concern you a bit more. Not really but I mean at some point there's going to be some fluctuation on a negative side for example but I'm not that worried about that. I mean our risk appetite has been well measured and our 10 plus EPS growth is really a long-term objective that we have. So right now we are way higher than the 10 percent. It might be that if the market tank for example there might be a slowdown into that but we've delivered 12 percent EPS growth over the last 10 years even more than our 10 plus guidance. So it's really a long-term approach that we have. How about the sales outlook? So obviously that's going to be something that jumps around from court. You talked about how book value matters was a long-term. I'm guessing same thing with sales trailing to a month basis. It looks a lot smoother. What's working and why is it working so well and what areas are you maybe looking to improve upon in terms of your sales flow right now across your business lines? I think one thing that is very important that this supersedes all the details is the fact that we tried to as an organization to act differently from our peers. I don't like to compete head-on against the other players in the industry in their market. So as an example in general we target the mass market or the mid-market. So let's take the example of individual insurance. You might not be aware of that but 28 percent of insurance policies in Canada is being sold by IA 28 percent. We're number one by far. Second is at 10 percent. So we really are a company that focuses on that specific market which we believe is more profitable and we this is really the IOA. The target market but at the same time they've loved the distribution in that target market. So we are present in distribution because we have for the most part products are being sold by our distributors, individual insurance, tech funds and etc. And so we try to I would say grow our distribution reach across Canada using technology as much as possible because again if we sell 250 000 insurance policies in a year you better have good technology because at your cost we will be very high. So we are at the right place in terms of cost low-cost producer investing in technology significantly to decrease our cost in a distribution space that serve our target market and that leads to great sales because we know that for example if we increase our career network distribution by 10 percent a year guess what next year our sales in that space will be up by 10 percent. It's kind of automatic. So we are really really focusing on these elements technology distribution and in our target market and that leads to a higher sales. Thanks for that color. Maybe switching over to capital just maybe remind investors of your priority. Well you kind of already did you know buybacks are the least appropriate use of your excess capital but on the M&A side RF capital the nice little addition and it's going to be modestly accretive adds to your wealth capabilities obviously perhaps investors might have thought the US was more so a destination for your excess capital how do you think about M&A business lines versus geography and what should what should the expectation be always funny because yes you're right when I was meeting investors I was saying that we focus on the US because we believe there's more opportunities and guess what the next announcement is about Canada. Well we have to be opportunistic also and but the higher the high level message that I gave to investors is that we are interested in investing in in organically in all sectors that we're in if there are opportunities in all sectors that we're in we are looking at it and we have a pipeline of opportunities that we're looking at obviously we we want to stay disciplined we want to respect our benchmark of our OE in all sectors but there are sectors that are more opportunities a US life for example is certainly one that I believe that we we could have more reach going forward I like that sector pretty much we've been very successful identifying organization that basically needed needed our strength to become profitable or more profitable that's what we did with American amicable that's what we did we're doing right now with varsity in the US so again that's that's really in all sectors that we're going back to your point about capital the capital deployment one thing that is important to mention is that our first choice is really to invest in our current business organically we are we've invested significantly in our technology we are continuing investing in technology to be at the forefront I believe that we are leaders in the industry in terms of technological tools especially on the front-end side and we see it on the individual insurance side on the sixth one side we see the wealth management side also we talked about the RF capital well for RF capital our platform has been is something that the advisors really appreciate after you know we are discussing with them obviously at this point and they do appreciate our platform okay thanks to that color maybe talking about the different businesses a little bit and I like to start with US dealer services that that's an area where you know you're looking to improve on you've had some hiccups lately that seems to be sort of clearing now I'm not sure if you're comfortable on that inflection point I know you've kind of indicated we might you might be close to that inflection point where does it sort of sit right now and and how do you still see the business and I'm guessing the new insurance you're writing the new new policies you're writing are a lot more profitable than some of the yeah the the what we're writing right now meets our our guidance for sure it's really you know in terms of the I mean I don't want to do the whole history but it's been very disappointing because of the timing of that acquisition and all the headwinds of the industry the auto industry that's affecting that business but our our our team and we've renewed some of our teams is is working on improving with surgically that operation we've made some changes in terms of pricing we've also right sized the expense as well that we've decreased by 5 percent our expense in that business you know taking into consideration inflation and we've invested in technology over the last few years now we are reaping the benefit out of it we we went from 6 to 2 systems and so we've been able to cut expenses based on that so I see a reversal of situation where the things are improving what I'm looking really is the increase in business like the sales and revenues versus the increase in the expense and right now it's going on the right direction so gradual improvement is my main message on that business there's not going to be miracle in the short term but I see that it's improving okay so right now it's all about optimization and once you get there is it fair to say then maybe the M&A opportunities yeah a bit more appealing to you yeah you're right it's going to take a couple of quarters before I go with let's see positive on doing a big acquisition we're looking at small ones but we're getting a big acquisition still need a couple of quarters and what are the dynamics of the US dealer services market is it one that's very fragmented where you can opportunistically bother yeah we're tough players winning in the space we're top seven in that market there are a lot of players it's fragmented I've always said there's our opportunities I know that there's going to be some businesses on the block soon so there are more I mean I can see that there are more opportunities in that sector okay switching over to Canada the insurance business in Canada maybe just talk a bit about individual and group how you sort of differentiate IA from again again I know the IA way you went to want to be different individual insurance has been a great success story continues to be a success story it's all about the IA way distribution first technology that supports that in our target market that we can scale the market I mean it's it's worked pretty well it's it's all about execution right now so there's no change in our strategy in the group business as well we target the mid-sized employer business we we take our share I mean we are we are we are a good player we are we can get some good cases that we learned recently so even though we are not in the top three in that business I believe that we can we do a great job right now so you do expect potential market share gains I'm just thinking about the business in Canada premiums tend to grow at GDP in individual maybe a little bit better in group and retirement solutions but would you expect to maybe have an opportunity to maybe take some share over time yeah of course but I see that in terms of growth I mean high single-digit low double-digit is pretty much in you know depending on the sectors obviously there's pretty pretty much the kind of sales increase that you should expect from our businesses okay what about on the well side obviously SAG funds big big part of your strategy here you're the top player in Canada maybe talk about the mutual fund space in terms of net outflows haven't really yeah I'll talk about mutual fund after I talk about SAG funds and one of not not only because SAG fund is doing much better but it's also because when I if you think about the proportion of our profitability coming from the various businesses in the wealth management space you know we've got the SAG fund business the distribution on the well side and at the end it's it's really the manufacturing of mutual fund so on the SAG fund part again it's insurance in insurance license distribution driven same as for individual insurance so the same thing distribution in our target market with technology that we can scale distribution for the wealth management RF is a great example of a significant talking acquisition we we're doing we are recognized as the number one non-bank distribution channel independent on the independent side in Canada it's been our focus it's been our recruiting pitch it's working very well and our F is just going to add on that and lastly mutual fund manufacturing the whole industry on the mutual fund side is is more difficult with obviously pressure on fees the ETF pressure as well we're in the same you know bag as as the other so we try there to I would say provide solutions to our distribution channel that encompasses a portion of our mutual fund manufacturing capability so that's how we we we focus our strategy so so had he sort of fixed that dynamic if the industry trend does it stuff it's tough on the manufacturing side we are improving but it's tough so that's something that you might look at maybe as not being a big focus for you if things don't improve in this I wouldn't say that it's not it's not in our radar let's for example to this divest in that business I think we're doing it pretty well in terms of profitability it adds to our profitability on the wealth management side so I'm happy where we stand right now okay and maybe going back to the site fund space maybe talk a bit about the competitive dynamics because obviously you're doing well there but maybe there's an element of it's not quite as crowded like the mutual fund production space would be maybe talk about talk about that a little bit is it a benefit to you that yes I'm so we're number one as you said and and gross sales net sale now we're number one in assets in the in that business so we're really the leader and kind of we've been for the last at least 10 years and again it's insurance distribution driven in our target market so give you an example okay we've got a client let's say a 50 grand of savings somewhere that is not really earning any return because it's sitting in you know I don't know GIC and so our guys go there and at some point diversified fund long term horizon for the client in a safe fund business that's great this is really the training that we provide to our distribution network on the and again it's insurance license driven network so it's complementary to what we're doing on the individual insurance side so it's really been a focus in our target market and again it's a market that's it's this crowded it's more profitable that's why we focus on that market so how do you sort of see that playing out over time with your it's gonna grow with distribution it's gonna go with distribution so our key our key focus is increasing distribution so it's to some extent it's it's not if let's say a it's a demand problem it's more like an offer problem I mean in Canada there are a lot of Canadians that are not well served either on the insurance side or even on the I would say the retirement planning side what about the distribution side obviously that's a big focus on seg funds or mutual funds more broadly like just distribution more broadly how do you compete in the market that tends to be dominated on the wealth side by the large Canadian banks because we provide an alternative to the to the bank we focus on distributors that are entrepreneurs in what we call independent space I mean to some extent banks forces their advisors to provide some kind of solutions right and what we have is an open architecture so if you are an entrepreneur and you want you want to work in an environment where you have more independence higher payout but you know you're gonna pay for your stuff you come to us we are recognized on the number one players in that field this is how we differentiate from bank and what's the sort of market share for that part of number one we're not you're not sure but but in terms of the out of the entire market what space does that occupy that entrepreneur and is that is that sort of growing do you see that growing better than industry overall like will it is an opportunity to get maybe more share of the overall pie yeah well if you compare with the bank banks are huge okay so I mean the whole market when you think about it banks are dominating the market okay this is not why we want to play we want to play as an alternative for those advisors that have are more entrepreneurial more independent and we this is really where we want to focus so in corporate expenses year to date roughly aligned with your expectations I think Q2 came in slightly higher any any commentary on expenses and how big of a focus is efficiency I'm very pleased there I've got my my chief financial officer with me sometimes I call him the cheap financial officer but because I mean I'm telling you we put a lot of focus on our expense management in the previous let's see the recent years and we're having fun but at the end of the day we have very serious discussion internally I would say that then two things the first one is about this operational leverage and skater that we have in all our businesses we really target an increase of revenue higher than increasing in in in expenses overall let's see not only one year let's see a three year or five year period so it's really been a focus we follow that very carefully and everyone has a target on that and the second thing is about I mean some extent how do we do that technology is a very key point there and we have a I would say a high level governance on technology that is very strong where we do for each of the significant technological that's a project we have a governance they have to be there's a business case like any acquisition to some extent okay except for let's say regulatory projects that really need to be done which sometimes is very difficult to measure the ROE but for all other let's see IT projects there is a business case there is an ROE that is associated with that there is a follow-up that we do after that and so it really fuels the operation operation operating leverage that I was talking about and we've been very successful in and you see you said that over the this year in terms of the objective or expenses we are pretty much in line with the objective except maybe for the fact that we have a higher compensation because the part of our compensation that obviously linked to our performance our performance have been outstanding so we if the year continues is it we probably be a bit more compensation based on our performance but if we remove that everything else is really in line with our expectation very tight management and we we are doing on a regular basis some comparison with the market there are some survey that are being done on the individual side not everywhere but on the individual side and in terms of acquisition cost administration cost we are on the right spot we mean i.e. lower than our competition okay and that's from independent analysis that you've seen on competitors yep numbers got it yeah maybe talk about the expenses in terms of technology obviously we're hearing that a lot more from the life goes I'm saying more so than the sort of more traditional business lines that are sort of being impacted is disrupted by technology improvements and and the service delivery to the end client maybe talk about that tech side and how that impacts your views on expenses how that informs your views on expenses well it's part it's part i mean we have no choice to invest in technology we invest about a four hundred million dollar a year in technology and as I said I mean I cannot say that we spend like two billion a year in technology I mean we don't have the means for that so we have to make smart choices and we've we've done some smart smart choices we choose IT projects where it fits where it reinforced our iEOE meaning for example distribution we we focus on building tools for our distributors that will be that will serve their clients in the target market that we're in as an example so we try not to be distracted by a lot of demands because obviously you can spend a lot in technology we're really really laser focused on reinforcing the iEOE and reinforcing our strategic intent so that's that's the way that I look at it AI is also something that we put more attention right now I'm telling you each of our employees can use chat GPT for as an example this is one area where we put some emphasis over the last year reinforcing the training the knowledge of our employees to be more productive as in as individuals using some AI tools that's one that's one thing and then the last thing I will mention is that we have user cases on AI still at the infancy there's no revolution at this point but both on the cost side and on the revenue generating side we have user cases with a great governance body that decides where is it that we're going to spend time and energy okay thanks that color maybe just one quick follow-up so on the sort of tech dynamic you clearly don't see that as a disadvantage given your your smaller scale versus your larger peers you mentioned making smart decisions is there any fintech dynamics any any partnership dynamic that's utilized as well or is it just all in house no I mean we're using an external provider obviously because you cannot build all the technology but at the end of the day I mean we have to be very careful who we choose as as as partners that's something that that is I would say in the industry in these days using external provider and managing external provider is a challenge so you have to be very careful of that and we don't as much as possible we don't do things in house unless there is a competitive advantage that we can draw from for example our tools on on the writing is something that we built in house because we believe we can have a competitive advantage out of that using AI so but but for the most part we try to use you know off-the-shelf technology go tools okay and maybe just one quick question on leverage obviously very low is that purposeful is there any sort of you know anything you want to offer on where you might be heading on leverage it seems like there's an opportunity to maybe maybe utilize it a bit more and would give you a lot more capacity yeah we are at the low end of let's say the leverage side we should increase it over time you should expect the leverage to increase over time I think it's good management of the capital and it's it's consistent with everything we've been saying in terms of deployment of capital going forward I mean so do so do expect that okay okay thanks for that last 30 seconds here I just want to turn it back over to you Danny if you have any key messages you want to know we've covered pretty much the iA way we've covered the the book value which is important and also we have a great momentum on the sell side so right now they're doing the company is doing very well and so thank you for all your support I'm talking to investors here awesome thank you very much for joining us today Danny thank you for all your insights thank you very nice to have you here and thanks for coming thank you
