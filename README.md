Welcome to our Q3 conference call. We delivered another strong quarter driven by strong tenant demand in our national grocery-anchored retail portfolio and newly seen activity across our well-located industrial assets. We maintained near full occupancy of 98% of 20 basis points from last quarter. We achieved healthy overall rent spreads of 10.8% during quarter, which included a significant amount of lot more annuals that will speak more about shortly. Our lot more leases continued to be a stable source of cash growth and were equally encouraged with a robust leasing activity from our third-party tenants in the quarter. Excluding the lot more annuals, our average rent spread was approximately 23%. This leasing activity underscores the strength of our overall portfolio and our team's ability to manage throughout certainty. We delivered as a phone call unit growth of 7.8% this quarter, supported in part by Lisa Render Revenue from our ongoing love law rightsizing initiatives. These initiatives remain a part of our active asset management strategy as we support love law in evaluating its spatial climate's nationwide while creating opportunities to introduce other high-quality, strong covenant tenants that enhance the overall quality of our sites. Excluding lease surrender revenues and other non-recurring items in both comparison periods, if a total unit growth was a very strong 3.5%. Aaron will provide more detail on our financial results and an update on our 2025 outlook later in the call. Our strong performances quarter comes and meets a backdrop of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty driven by trade-related risks in Canada and abroad. Despite this, our portfolio continues to demonstrate its resilience and our commitment to prudent financial management has enabled our teams to execute on our growth initiatives. Turning to our portfolio, we continue to see the time to retail market nationwide, fueling strong demand for grocery-ended neighborhood centers. We also see particular strength among necessity-based and discount retail tenants. Our national portfolio is well positioned to continue pressuring this momentum and benefit from these favorable market dynamics. Our team remains active in new leasing initiatives at our existing assets while our industry-leading balance sheet and strategic partnership with law law enables us to continue delivering new retail space through intensifications and greenfield development. With this strategic focus on expanding our high-quality retail portfolio and improvement track record of execution, we're well equipped to deliver sustained growth and maximize value. In the quarter, we delivered seven new retail intensification projects at a crack of yields. Further intensifying our neighborhood centers, something now will expand on shortly. In addition to intensifying our existing size, we also continue to leverage a balance sheet and relationship with law law to pursue new greenfield opportunities. During the quarter, we completed a 9 million acquisition of a 50% interest in a greenfield size in Ottawa. This 13-acre size will feature new shopping center totaling approximately 120,000 square feet, anchored by no throws and a shopper's front mark which we will develop and manage on behalf of our partner. Our industrial portfolio remains in excellent shape and our team delivered another strong quarter of leasing activity as occupants increased 30 basis points to 98.3%. Leasing spread with robust and nearly 38% driven by third party standard renewals, while the overall industrial market continues to normalize, our portfolio remains well positioned to drive further growth given the meaningful gap between in place and market rents. We also maintain a significant industrial development pipeline, including approximately 220 acres of developable land remaining at choice, calendar and business cost. In the quarter, we announced our intention to begin the next phase of our calendar project on a speculative basis. This decision wasn't thought about a conviction in the GTA's industrial market. The location of our site, the competitive advantage provided by low land cost basis and the increased RFP activity we're experiencing on the site. Lastly, in our mixed use and residential portfolio, we saw corner of solid momentum. Our office portfolio is primarily leased to familiar entities and occupancy in the quarter was largely stable. On the residential side, we continued to experience some pressure from new supply at certain assets. However, looking ahead, we continued to have a strong conviction in the quality of our residential product and optimistic about the long-term residential fundamentals in major urban markets in Canada. Turning to our transaction activity in the quarter, we remain focused on maintaining our portfolio, positive through capital recycling, completing approximately 118 million internal real estate transactions during and subsequent to the quarter. This included the non-million retail land acquisition in Ottawa that I mentioned previously and 100 non-million of non-core asset dispositions. On the disposition front, we saw the 50% interest in a non-growth shopping centre in Edmonton for approximately non-million. In subsequent to corner end, we completed three additional dispositions, including a retail portfolio of four assets in Ontario for $67 million, a 50% interest in a retail asset in Cameron's Alberta for $23 million, and a Canadian-type landee in COU at a retail site imports Saskatchewan Alberta for approximately $10 million. All we expect to remain roughly balanced for the rest of the year, positioning us as net acquirers in this year in line with our transaction activity today. Our industry leaving down sheet supports, continues to support as being net acquirers in the future, complementing existing cash flow and growth and development growth fellas, and we will continue to maximize that use for unit all this. With that, I'll turn the poll over to now to discuss operational results in more detailed now. Thank you, Real. Good morning, everyone. As Real mentioned, our portfolio delivered another solid quarter of operational results, and we continue to see strong tenant demand in leasing spreads across each of our portfolio types. Overall portfolio occupancy remains strong, ending the quarter at 98%. This was a 20 basis point increase to the prior quarter. During the quarter, we had over 3.7 million square feet of D6 and renewed approximately 3.6 million square feet, resulting in a retention rate of 96%. Overall, the portfolio renewals were completed at an average rental spread of 10.8%, excluding the law of law renewals. A renewal spread was a very healthy 23.1%. We also completed 291,000 square feet of absorption of 135,000 square feet, largely driven by our Ontario industrial portfolio, Quebec retail portfolio. Turning to each of our asset classes, in our necessity-based retail portfolio, occupancy was unchanged at 97.8%. During the quarter approximately 3.2 million square feet of NACES expire, including 2.8 million of law of law maturity. We renewed approximately 3.1 million square feet, including 2.7 million square feet from the law of law tranche, for retention of 97%. Given the lack of new retail supply, vacating tenants or air determinations have provided opportunities to back those states and elevated rental rates with stronger economies. These renewals spread average 9% above expiring rates, and 12.9% excluding the law of law tranche, with ball-braised trends across all of our regions and categories led by value reserves. We also completed 148,000 square feet new leasing. Average rents over the lease term are 42% higher than our average in-place rents. This largely offsets the 95,000 square feet of expiries that did not renew in the quarter. Our team has already backed the proportion of the space, at rent 49% above previous rates, and remain confident in the leasing activity on the remaining space. Turning to our industrial portfolio, occupancy increased 30 basis points from our last quarter to 98.3%. This quarter, 491,000 square feet expired, primarily in our Alberta and Atlantic portfolios, and we renewed 430,000 square feet for a healthy 87.6% retention rate. We had two vacancies in the quarter, one of which has already been backed over Q4, and negotiations are on the way for the property. Least renewals spreads remain strong, averaging 48.3% above our rents, driven by the Alberta and Ontario portfolios. In the Ontario portfolio, we completed one renewal for 57,000 square feet, a rent spread of 183%. Excluding the 189,000 square feet of law-law renewal, the average renewal spread for the portfolio was approximately 62%. We also completed 142,000 square feet of new leasing, again 61,000 square feet of vacates, resulting in a positive absorption of 81,000 square feet. New leasing rents averaged over the lease term are 32% higher than our average influence rents. Lastly, our mixed use and residential portfolio continues to perform well, but occupancy at 95.5%, which is up 10 basis points from the last quarter, and has increased 140 basis points a year to date, primarily from strong performance where we enter mixed use access. Turning toward developments in the quarter, our team continues to advance your development pipeline across each of our strategic asset classes with near-term focus on commercial development. This quarter, our team delivered seven retail intensification projects, totaling 107,000 square feet at a blended yield of 6.3%. Project deliveries included two shoppers drug marks in Ontario and Alberta, totaling 34,000 square feet at yields in the mid-6s and 7s, and we have another seven shoppers drug marks currently in active development. A T&T and CRU and Mississauga totaled 44,000 square feet. Two CRU units in Alberta with an internationally cosmetic retailer, totaling 7,000 square feet at yields in the high-date range. And finally, two ground leases out of property in Ontario and Alberta totaling 22,000 square feet on an average weighted yield of approximately 11%. One of the ground leases with an article with whom we have a deep relationship, and the other ground lease is with attendance in the automotive sector. As Real mentioned earlier, this quarter highlights our team's ability to unlock incremental value from existing retail portfolio and land bank true intensifications in new development. These type of retail initiatives remain a cornerstone of our broader development strategy, and we will continue to actively pursue opportunities to deliver high-quality retail projects. Looking ahead for the balance of the year, our major active development project continues to be our industrial pipeline at Joyce, Caledon Business Park. The NLS building totaling approximately 624,000 square feet, of which we own 85%, was transferred to IPP on November 1st, and rent commencement is on track for April 2026. With this delivery, our team is now focused on the next phase of industrial development Caledon. This quarter we announced our intention to begin construction of 1 million square for building on spec before the end of the year. Performance are submitted and delivery is scheduled for Q2-2027. Overall, our active development pipeline totals 12 projects of approximately 1 million square feet, and an average forecasted yield of approximately 6.9%. Our development pipeline continues to be a reliable source of long-term cash flow in that growth for our portfolio. I will now pass it over to Aaron to discuss your financial performance. Thank you now, and good morning everyone. We are very pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance. Our reported funds from operations for the second quarter was 201.4 million or 27.8 cents on a per unit-deluded basis, reflecting an increase of 7.8% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Included in our results this quarter, we had approximately 10 million of lease surrender revenue. Last year, we had approximately 5 million of lease surrender revenue and 3.3 million of non-recurring GNA expenses related to outsourcing. As Real mentioned, our lease surrender revenue is mainly due to our right sizing activities with law law, where we are able to add high-quality third-party tenants to our sites, and law law law is able to right size their store to a smaller footprint. These initiatives demonstrate the benefits of our strategic partnership with law law and do not occur consistently throughout the year. Excluding these items, FFO per unit growth remained strong at 3.5%. FFO growth was primarily due to strong operational results and contributions from net acquisitions and development transfers over the last 12 months, partially offset by higher net interest expense. A FFO this quarter was 19.2 cents per unit, which was impacted by the earlier timing of executing on our maintenance capital projects. On a full year basis, we expect our 2025 maintenance capital and A FFO payout ratio to be relatively consistent with the prior year. Turning to our operational results, same asset cash and a Y increased by 7 million or 2.8% compared to the third quarter of 2024, given by higher base rents from rent steps and strong leasing activities. By asset class, retail, same asset cash and a Y increased by 5.8 million or 3.1%. The increase was primarily driven by leasing activities, which included the impact of our level of lease renewals in the quarter and higher base rents on contractual rent steps. Retail growth was also favorably impacted by higher capital recovery revenue. Industrial, same asset cash and a Y increased by approximately 0.8 million or 1.6%. The increase was primarily due to higher base rents from contractual rent steps and leasing activities. Brows in the quarter was tempered by prior year property tax recoveries and other income items, including prior year items, same asset cash and a Y growth would have been approximately 3.3%. Mixed use and residential, same asset cash and a Y increased by approximately 0.4 million or 4%. Moving to our balance sheet, our IFX net asset value or net for the quarter was $14.53 per unit, an increase of $111 million or approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of 2025. Now, Brows was driven by a net contribution from operations of $56 million and net fair value gain on our investment properties of $13 million and a fair value gain on our investment in the units of allied properties. As a reminder, we are required under IFRS to mark to market the investment allied to its trading price at each period. Our fair value gain on investment properties in the quarter was primarily driven by cash flow growth, favorable leasing and back fill initiatives in our retail segment. This more than offset a fair value decrease related to certain asset specific leasing adjustments in our industrial portfolio. This quarter, we also completed several successful financing, most notably our $500 million dual tranche unsecured debenture offering in August. The transaction included a $350 million series W unsecured debenture at a 4.6 to 8% coupon with a 10-year term and $150 million series X debenture at a 5.369% coupon with a 30-year term. The dual tranche offering carried a weighted average coupon of approximately 4.85% and a 16-year average term, extending our debt maturity profile to 6.8 years. Our team capitalized on a very strong credit environment with the issuances representing both the tightest ever 10 and 30-year spreads for choice. We saw exceptional demand for these issuance with the combined offering being over 9 times over subscribed. This transaction continues to demonstrate our strong position in the market and our ability to source low-cost capital while also accessing the long end of the curve, providing the flexibility needed to prudently manage our balance sheet and maintain a well-structured debt ladder. Proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay maturing debt, including the redemption at par of our 200 million series F unsecured debenture in September and approximately 100 million of mortgages that matured in the quarter. The remaining proceeds were used for general purposes and to pay the rebalances on a revolving credit facility. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, our team has largely addressed the few remaining maturity with our next significant debt maturity not occurring until our unsecured debenture due in November 2026. We ended the quarter in solid financial position with strong debt metrics and full liquidity, including approximately 1.5 billion of available liquidity, including credit on our corporate facility and available cash, and 13.7 billion of unencumbered properties. Our debt to even the ratio was 7.1 times, which was down 0.1 times from last quarter as we capture earnings related to our acquisition activity earlier in the year. Supported by our strong year-to-date operating performance, including our team's ability to execute on a transaction strategy and deliver on our right-sizing initiatives of law law, we have increased our guidance for 2025 FFO per unit to approximately 106 to $1.107, representing year over year growth of approximately three to four percent. With that, Real and I will be glad to answer your questions. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And our first question today comes from a line of Mark Rothschild from Canacord. Your line is open. Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. It sounds like you're comfortable progressing with industrial development now, and I'm just curious your thoughts on undertaking new developments on larger mixed-use projects at a time of general residential developments, especially in the condo market. If stops are slowing, projects take quite some time. Are you looking at advancing any of these projects now, or still do the numbers? Maybe it's not work right now. Hang off the trail, if you will. I think the way we think about it is we're a long-term learner of real estate. And if you start one of these projects now, the only end delivered in three or four years, and you're releasing it up in a very different environment than we are today. So given we take that long view, our balance sheet is strong. And there are quite a few available incentives at the moment that he is working on trying to capture. So we actually think we're going to be in a position to launch one of these in 2026, because we believe it's the right long-term investment. I don't know if you want to add anything else. Yeah, just to add to that, Mark, there's being a progressive decline in costs that come down approximately 15% over the last couple of years. So it's really improving the dynamics of how we're evaluating some of these performance. There's a lot of appetite in the markets from new projects. So we think schedules will improve as well. So overall, we're seeing a change in dynamics that I think could be created very quickly. But I guess, Rael, we should wait a little bit to hear your announcement on which project it is and what the plan is. Yeah, so we hope to have something in the early plan of 2026. Okay, great. I'll wait on that. Thanks so much. Your next question comes from a line of Himenshu Gupta from Scotia Bank. Your line is open. Thank you and good morning. So your video occupancy continues to be strong. Should we expect occupancy to be stable from here? Or do you expect any uptick in the near term? And at the same time, you know, any pockets of like software using demand within the retail side? I want you to just respond to that. On our retail, going into Q4, we're expecting a little bit of growth in occupancy, improving. And in our industrial portfolio, we see occupancy improving as well. Okay, that's fantastic. And on the video, thanks for the answer there. I mean, in the context of this population, growth has slowed down and GDP growth also slowed down. So it sounds like like no pocket of sickness, you guys will see. I'd say there's a lot of catch up from the immigration that has happened over the last number of years, and retail and residential and industrial are still trying to catch up with that, particularly in retail. Okay, okay. Thank you for that. And maybe my next question is on that Caledon industrial property. I mean, it sounds like you're making progress on that, you know, that 1 million square feet of development on spec. Do you have a sense of, you know, what kind of tenant demand will be there for that kind of product? We're very encouraged by the responses we've been getting to RFPs. It's a mix of logistics, electronics. There's a lot of growth there. We're seeing built to suit as well as interest in our spec as well. So there's a good variety there for us. And what kind of use will you be underwriting on that project? Similar yields that we've been, you know, achieving today on our IPP portfolio and, you know, our NLS project is transferring in the next quarter. We expect to see yields similar to that. Okay. Thank you. Maybe just last question. I mean, on your allied holdings, and I know it's a small part of the lab. Any thoughts, you know, there's a distribution card, what could be the impact of your FFO test, you know. Yeah, look, Comanche, I think just to answer what we've always said, we've always said that, you know, a view that the underlying real estate, you know, is great long-term real estate. We also recognize that office fundamentals are starting to improve. And then we don't need the capital right now. Look, we don't know exactly what the distribution class is going to be until they officially announce it. But, you know, it's not going to have a material you know, impact on our business. Our business is strong. And, you know, we'll provide an update when we know the magnitude of the cut. Go ahead. Fair enough. Thank you guys. And I'll turn it back. Your next question comes from a line of Sam Demiani from TD Cowan. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. It's really interesting to see the retail shopping center development kickoff in the PN. I'm just wondering if now perhaps you could share a little bit of sort of thoughts about how you're underwrote the opportunity and, you know, expected rents versus costs kind of yields. Like, is this an opportunity that has opened up, you know, just in recent, in the recent year, let's say, with the rising market rents, is this an opportunity that could really expand across more so in a bigger way across the country? So Sam, what I say, but we have a number of opportunities for locations across Canada. We're working on for grocery stores and CRU. We are seeing rents improved to underwriters. But they're in the, they're where they need to be for underwriting, so they're in the 50s. But we'll give you more input when we talk to you in Q4. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe, real, I mean, Lucy guys have been acquiring these industrial outside storage assets over the last few years. The asset class has become more popular. Do you, are you still seeing opportunities in that space to acquire going forward? Sam, we haven't seen any, you know, real interesting new opportunities since we acquired the portfolio. I can tell you that numerous people have reached out to us to acquire portions of that portfolio and significantly higher values than we paid, which I think leads to your comment on, you know, the significant investing interest in the asset class. That's helpful. And just lastly, you know, Mark asked about, I guess, residential construction, so look forward to, I guess, seeing some details when that's announced. So I did have any initial thoughts on the federal budget announced a couple of days ago and and how that sort of impacts, you know, the way you look at building new, new residential residents drilling in Canada. We've been digesting it as it's been coming out over the last couple of days. You can see that there's a lot of it, it emphasis towards infrastructure, which we feel is very important for some of our very large master plan projects. We're not quite sure how the impact and DCs has gone to be trickling down to, you know, the provinces and the municipalities, so I think we're waiting for more information to come out and build Canada homes. We're waiting to see how that's going to work as well. So I think there's more information to come out as the budget gets discussed over the next couple of weeks. That's great. I'll turn it back. Thank you. Your next question comes from a line of towel woolly from CIBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Is this working on the retail business where Loblaw is where you're sort of terminating some of these leases or looking to you downsize? Are they switching banners while they're doing it? Hi, towel. It's not necessarily them switching banners. I mean, they could. It's more those look at a store and say we have a store that's 150 to 160,000 square feet. Could we make the same amount or, you know, service do the same sales on a smaller footprint of say 120,000 square feet, 125,000 square feet. So it's more of that. And then what happens is choice will go out to the market and see if we can find a third-party tenant. And only when we do, we'll tell Loblaw we're okay for them to reduce the space. But if we wanted a third-party tenant, we would never let them reduce the store footprint. And the interesting thing. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Pardon me, Real. Go ahead. No, I'll just think. I will tell you that the interesting thing and maybe now I can also comment is that our leasing team is saying that, you know, on the size, that we backfilling on the downsizing is really a lack of available, you know, space on the market. So we've had really strong tenant interest in that space, which has been, you know, a positive to offer that space to tenants. Yeah, NVIDIA, the ICSC, we had a lot of interest in our land bank and our opportunities in trying to find large space and difficult for our tenants that are looking to grow in a number of sectors. So right-sizing is definitely a solution and also some of our new developments for Greenfield as well to provide opportunities for them too. And is there a theme on any of these? Like is it a certain region or a certain side store that sort of predominate this group? No, I wouldn't call it on a theme. I think it's, you know, we've done ones in Toronto, Montreal and in Alberta. I don't think it's a regional theme. That's, you know, opportunity as they as well, refreshing, you know, the interior of their store. We work with them too. Okay, perfect. But for me, thank you. Again, if you'd like to ask a question, press star one in your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from a line of Gileano Thornhill from National Bank Financial. Your line is open. Hey guys, good morning everyone. Just wondering on the 8.6% renewals with law laws, I'm just wondering what would be required to see this kind of reach the maximum and looking out like further up to 20, 20, so kind of where is that trending? Hi, it's Rael. Look, I think, I think you have to understand this, you know, 40, you know, call it 25ish leases rolling a year. And the nature of our leases are that they can be no less than the expiry of the, you know, expiry rent and no more than 10% growth. So we actually think, you know, eight and a half percent, you know, is a really healthy left given the nature of all the leases. And look, we don't have yet the ability of 27, and we're happy to share it when we have it. But I think it would be very difficult to get to the maximum 10 because it would imply that every single lease is, you know, at least 10% below market when it's rolling. And remember, these leases were set in 2013 at market rounds. And Gileano, just one thing to add is the geographic spread on these locations as well. It's across Canada and various markets. Right. And then just going back to kind of Todd's line of questioning, just, how many more kind of opportunities do you think are for these, you know, larger developments? And where has kind of been the lack of grocery, you know, under construction in the country over the last little bit? Look, I think one of our main competitive advantages is that we're working with Lovelord to say, you know, where are you trying to expand? And how can we help you find land? For example, just on the grocery side, you know, we had announced, I think, one or two quarters ago, we were building call at six new grocery stores. And, you know, I think in pretty much most cases, we're building additional COU as well. You know, like, I don't want to, I don't want to lean too much into where the locations are. On that, I can tell you where the six are, but I don't want to lean too much into where the locations of the future opportunities we're looking at with Lovelord that now can maybe just comment on where the border's the far remaining are. Look, currently, they're typically out west in Ontario. And as we go through and look at our Python, we think we're going to see more coming in from Quebec as well. So it's a national, we're seeing a national opportunity, Ontario, on west, Edmonton, Calgary, and some opportunities in Quebec that we're evaluating at the moment. Right. And then just lastly, there's a, you know, conservatory group was kind of put up for sale recently. I'm wondering if any of the assets are kind of catch your interest within the portfolio. I think we just signed, we're just on the NDA to get access to the data room. And hopefully, there'll be something that's not criteria, but nothing to share yet. Right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pammie Burr from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. Just on the least termination income from Lovelord, just how many properties did that relate to? And then secondly, just to clarify, has all of that exterminated space been released? So Pammie, sorry, it related to three properties, and we actually put in five different CRU tenants across those properties, so it'd be like a dollar a month, good life, LCBO, and it's all been released. When we do these, they are released before we go ahead and do them. Okay. All right. And then should we, you know, as we think about, you know, just looking at for 2026 and maybe even beyond, is this, you know, this process, you know, likely to continue, maybe at the similar sort of volume annually, or is this bit of a unique period in terms of their right sizing? Yeah. So I say we've had this for the last couple of years. I think there'll be a few in 2026 and maybe 27. I wouldn't expect large volumes to continue to all depend on 10 demand market and lava looking at their stores and where they're renovating, but we do have some in 26. Okay. And then just lastly, on the 100 million of dispositions, I guess, after the quarter, what was sort of the range or the capillary range on those asset sales and maybe just if you could comment on the likelihood of further capillary cycling next year? Yeah. I think the average cap rate or the rate was all close to a 7, so a 7 cap. And as we said, on the call, look, our balance is in great shape. And this year we were announced from a capital recycling point of view, i.e. purchasing more than we sold and we've done a significant number of transactions. And I think, you know, we in the position to continue to do that in future and maybe as an extension to that, would that include perhaps monetizing some of the residential density as it gets owned or is that not really on the table at this stage? I think in this environment it's tough at the moment. It's something we may consider in the future, but not really something we considering at the moment. Okay. Thanks very much. I'll turn it back. Your next question comes from a line of Garov-Methar from Green Street. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just one question on the disposition activity so far. You know, is there, is it fair to say that, you know, there's a lack of liquidity now in the market when compared to probably nine to 12 months ago, as you were looking through your capital quick second plan? Look, I think from our standpoint, we wouldn't agree with that statement. We actually think for the product that we've been selling, there's been lots of liquidity. So usually even the portfolio, there was roughly, you know, $100 million. The average asset size was each $25 million. And the pool of buyers, you know, it's deep, it's institutions, it's for the product we've been selling, we haven't seen a lack of lack of liquidity. And by extension, would that also be applicable to the industrial market? Again, if you look at this, again, it hasn't been a lot of trading on the industrial market. They've been, you know, I think they in, you know, I think this past quarter, they were two significant trades. And again, they were, you know, large assets were, from our point, seems to have good liquidity on it too. Okay. And then I'll share with you as well on, I'll also share with you when we sold the small bank portfolio earlier in the year, you know, there was strong investor interest and, you know, appetite for more of that as well, if we were to be willing to sell more assets. Thank you, Real. I'll turn it back to the operator. Your next question comes from a line of Sam Demiani from T.E. Cowan. Your line is open. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the, on the La Bla space that was, was, was, was given back and, and generated the least surrendered fees. That is all in respect of store downsizing. There were no stores completely closed. Is that correct? That's correct, Sam. Thank you very much. And I will now turn the call back over to Real Diamond CEO for some final closing remarks. Thank you, Rob. As I mentioned at the start of my call, a portfolio balance sheet on excellent shape and our team remains focused on achieving our growth objectives. Thank you all for your interesting choice. And for joining us this morning, we look forward to providing you another update on the business in the year. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
