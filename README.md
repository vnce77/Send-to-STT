Before we begin, I would like to submit the following poll and I would now like to hand you over to CEO Puan Conway. Good afternoon to you. Thank you very much and thank you very much to everybody who's attending this call. I think we've got a really good attendance today so thank you for making the time. We're going to be talking through our results for the first six months of this year. We've got a presentation to run through. What we'll do is we'll keep the presentation reasonably short and succinct so there should be plenty of time to ask questions afterwards and if you put your questions through then clearly we'll try and answer as many of those as we can as we go through the meeting. So if we can move on, so very briefly today I'll give a little bit of an introduction. I'm then going to talk through, as I always do, a couple of case studies just for those of you who are less familiar with TPX Impact and the businesses that are there and what we do, give you a bit of a flavour around that and then we'll then talk to the H1 financial results and also cover our ESG measures and then I'll talk a little bit about the market both in terms of generally where the public sector market is for our sort of services so public sector primarily but also what that means for us for the balance of this year. So if we've gone to the next slide, for those of you who haven't met before, I'm Bjorn Conway, I'm Chief Executive of TPX Impact, I've been with the business about three years and largely what we're going to be talking through today is a three-year plan that we initiated shortly after I joined and I'm going to talk through some of the strategic and operational points around that. So we've gone to the next slide. So in terms of our key objectives for the three-year plan, essentially the three-year plan that TPX Impact and the Planner plea before undertook a lot of acquisitions and brought some really, really good businesses together, unfortunately some of that coming together went less well as planned than planned and so this three-year plan was really about getting the business back from a situation where we had as you'll see later in the presentation about 24 million of gross debt, we had an EBITDA on every trade show on our net debt of about 7.6 times when we had a banking covenant living two and a half times to a position now where we're trending towards that EBITDA net debt ratio at about one times and we've also seen EBITDA progress through that three-year period. So really that speaks to a story of trying to take those original businesses to cluster them in sensible groups and to help that business perform and we've made a number of decisions through that. A lot of it is around improving our financial performance both in terms of cash management and that conversion of revenue through to EBITDA and you can see that in these results in terms of the progress around EBITDA margin and gross margin and the reduction of net debt. We've also done a lot of operational streamlining so we are now managing three business units as opposed to nine when I first arrived so that's allowed us both to focus on those business units but also to streamline some of the operations that surround them. We tried to do that whilst staying true to the principles of many of the founding organisations and that's our employee retention rate is currently at 91 percent so we're very proud of the environment we've managed to maintain through what has been a very significant period of change. Throughout that we're obviously a client serving business and it's really fundamental to us that we remain focused on the value we deliver and the impact we deliver for our clients so I'm going to go through a couple of examples we go through this presentation some of clients that we've had for many years and we're actual clients of the predecessor organisations and some new clients that have come on board very recently and the sort of value we create for them. So the sort of story of the last three years has really been around operational streamlining so a little bit as about looking at what our clients are asking from us and making sure we've got the right people and the right services internally to offer that. Looking wherever we can at the indirect cost and the indirect support to those kind of delivery services to try and make sure we've got a very lean and agile structure and if you like the summary for the whole of the transformation programme is we really wanted to get the business to a point where we were providing really good solid financial outcomes but also we built a platform for future growth and a lot of the things a lot of the levers we've pulled during this time obviously around utilisation so that's about thinking where do our best people work and how do we provide them with the opportunities to do great work for clients. In enhancing profitability you'll see that where particularly when Noel speaks later about the consistency of that progression and that's despite sort of market conditions being quite tricky over the election and the periods following the election and obviously very pleased about the debt situation now I think we're in a position where we're operating with very comfortable levels of debt particularly in line with the profitability of the business now and as I said earlier the main thing here is about the platform for future growth and so we sort of fine-tuning our investment in the business really around new business development so we have a new health partner that's joined recently we're sort of refocusing some of the new business development team and we're also very focused where you know building on our foundations of very long-term and deep relationships with our clients around account retention and growth to make sure that we're making the best of the opportunities to exist in the public sector market. So I'll pop this next slide in just to act as a reminder for where we have ended up at the sort of two and a half years into that three-year plan so we go to market through three brands and the reason for having three brands is we're actually speaking to three different client groups and we want to be very clear about the proposition and the offer for those client groups. So TPX Impact we call internally the DT business or digital transformation business but that's really our go-to-market brand for end-to-end digital transformation so that's everything from policy to user-centered design to the data analytics and the technology that supports that primarily public sector focused kits or keep it simple is really aimed at program recovery manage services deep technical expertise tends to operate with the really sort of heavy lifting systems of payment processing systems for example and manifesto is an agency so it's a digital experience agency really concentrates and plays very well in the not-for-profit or charity space and also in the visits and attraction space where it's all about engaging with people getting them to come back and taking on that journey from being engaged to being active donors so these are the three businesses that we have kind of resolved the initial group of businesses on the panoply into and as I said at the beginning I'm just going to talk a little bit about a couple of client case studies and these I'll come on to those in a minute but what I want to do first of all is just paint a picture of the landscape of clients we've got so we can go on to the next slide so a lot of these will be names that you may recognize so we've got a lot of the main government departments are represented here ministry of justice you'll have seen our release earlier in the year about his Majesty's prisons and probation service where we've secured a nine-million-pound piece of work with a potential for a 50 percent extension on that land registry is our largest client remains our largest client it's a four-year 49 million-pound program and we've also got some clients on here who we've had more recently so to speak to a couple of those people like the World Wildlife Fund people like Waterade people like the City of London recently acquired clients I'm going to pick up on a couple of these in a couple of case studies so the first case study really sort of speaks to the fact that we get involved in active problem-solving and policy development quite early on in the process so we're not just producing technology solutions or data analytic solutions so this example here is with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and this is an area where both in terms of TPX and the predecessor organizations we've had a really good history and close client relationships so if you like the exam question here was how do we look at the process of house buying and where do we look how do we look at capturing some of the values of reducing the number of those sales that fall through primarily because the process is difficult or the data is not quite in the right place so how can we think about that from the application of clearer policies clearer data solutions and technology support to try and reduce those fall throughs now the reason why that's a really interesting piece of work is because it gets us involved in the conversations in the department at a really early level around you know what sort of problems are they tackling what sort of solutions exist and you can see in this example we identified sort of improvements that would reduce the number of fall throughs by about 16 percent and because of the scale of things that happen in government that can lead to a value for the government department involved in terms of a cost saving of 231 million so these can be quite significant and then it allows us to be well positioned for the follow-on work so that's an example from TPX impact that goes to market on the digital transformation space and another example is R&I B so one of the longest established charities in the UK and this talks to our manifesto business so as I said at the beginning our manifesto business is very much around being a digital engagement agency experience agency so it's very much about how do you engage with people in the appropriate way how do you convert that engagement if you're a visit in the traction how do you keep people coming back how do you keep them engaged with that attraction if you're a charity how do you keep them engaged so either they benefit from the information charity can provide or they turn into donors and support the charity again as you would expect there were really hard outcomes to this sort of work so you can see here working with R&I B looking at how they actually engage the strategy that sits behind that sort of tools and techniques that they use we can demonstrate really tangible results so we speak here to click through rates that are 84 higher than they would otherwise achieve and also sort of getting through through personalized emails again higher click through rates 63 percent higher than would originally envisage and so that really speaks to and the manifesto business really speaks to the experience of the people in that business and across tpx generally of people who've walked in their client shoes really understand their business and can actually help them optimize what they do so i'm going to stop there and i'm just going to hand over to Noel to talk a little bit about the half one financial results thanks very much people and hello everyone thank you so much for joining us as I attend to our headline numbers now for the first half of 2025 and i'd just like to echo Bjorn's comments to start really it's been a good first half overall in line with the three-year plan we're really pleased the group has continued to move forward in all key profitability measures and also reduced our net debt despite some headwinds to top line revenue over the period and just focusing on revenue initially i think it's a what to set some concepts for everyone on the call so our first half is April to september and over that period the first two and a half months were prior to the coming to spending review which came up on June 11th and in our digital transformation unit in particular that goes to markets tpx in fact we saw a continuation of the uncertain and somewhat disrupted market that we experienced much of last fiscal year the remaining ones post spending review saw growing pipeline activity but muted by the normal porting whiteboard summer period so as a result revenue for the six months ended 30th of september 2025 was 36.2 million down 4% from 37.8 million in the prior year just moving on to gross margin the first half recorded gross margin 31.0% and improvement of 2.7% from the prior year of 28.3 driven by higher average utilization over the period and robust pricing and adjusted even though i was up to 3.2 million up 0.9 million or 39% compared to 2.3 million in the prior period driven by the proven and gross margin just mentioned and the benefit of restructuring actions taken midway through last financial year so those improvements led to better adjusted to even down margin of 8.8% for the period up 2.7% compared to 6.1% for the same period last year and that led to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1.7p compared to 1.2p for the first half of last year net debt as we've already mentioned fell to 7.5 million up half year down sequentially from eight and a half million at the end of last financial year driven by healthy cash conversion from our even dart over the period and that takes us to leverage at the half year measured as net debt over adjusted eep dart at just 1.1 times down from 1.5 times at the end of FY 25 and beyond we'll talk about our updated guidance to net debt in his closing comments. Looking on this chart as well in the bottom left corner you can see revenue by sector splits and in the bottom left hand side you can kind of see that 69% of the bulk of our revenue comes from cards to central government no change to the last recent periods but just wanted to add a bit of colour here by breaking up central government revenue and showing a little bit about the different areas and departments that we work with so in the right hand pie chart you can see that of the central government revenue 53% comes from projects linked to place and infrastructure particular strength powers largely working with his Majesty's Land Registry and the Ministry of Housing and Communities Land and Government that we all just highlighted in his case study. 16% comes from project linked to the environment and 11% from energy and trade 10% from justice and 10% from other areas so we're reasonably comfortable with the spread of different departments that we are working with but we feel a good long-term priorities for any government. We're also very proud of the relationships we've built across the central government departments and our reputation for delivering against plant outcomes is reflected in the healthy tenure that we can see on the right hand side of this graphic with four-fifths of our revenue coming from cards we've worked with for at least three years. So just turning out to the charts of revenue and adjust the diva data over time you can see on the left-hand side revenue in H126 at a slightly lower level to the same period last year and on the right-hand side you can see an EBITDA chart steady progress over the last three and a half years with gradually increasing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin moving up from 0.9 million adjusted EBITDA and just under 3% adjusted EBITDA margin in the first half of 23 on the left-hand side of the chart all the way up to 3.2 million adjusted EBITDA and 8.8% EBITDA margin for the half-year results that we're just reporting. So the last three years have seen a really significant turnaround in the group's finances and the current structure of three distinct operating units that you all mentioned sets us up well with a settled management team and a lean supporting cost structure for continued improvements in the future. Just turning to indebtedness we've touched on this already but I'll start with the net debt waterfall on the left-hand side we closed financial year 25 with net debt of 8.5 million as I've mentioned and during the first half of this financial year the group has generated 2.6 million of cash and operations paid interest payments on borrowings of 0.5 million made limited purchases of shares into the employee benefit trust from 0.1 million and paid 0.5 million for long-term leases leading to the closing net debt of 7 million at the half-year that I mentioned previously. We're pleased with our progress in reducing net debt over the half and the chart on the right-hand side kind of shows how growth borrowings have also gradually reduced over a long time period. So we've moved from a growth borrowing of nearly 25 million in FY23 through steady debt reduction over the last three years for a combination of disposers and non-con businesses really careful cost control and operational improvements leading to the growth debt we've switched over at 7 million you can see for the half-year just closed. And just to round out this section then I'm going to talk a little bit about our non-financial metrics and ESG metrics. So we ended the half with total headcount of 552 heads including associates of which 405 were permanent TPX employees. Our female representation remains healthy at 50% and our ethnic minority representation was stable and healthy compared to the market average of 20%. Our carbon emissions for the half or 699 tons and our carbon intensity for the period expressed as tons of CO2 per million pounds of revenue was 19.3 with a small increase compared to the prior driven by a small uptick in purchase goods and services. And finally as Bjorn's already mentioned we're really pleased that our employee retention rate remains high at 19% which compares pretty favorably to the IT sector average. So I'll hand back to Bjorna to talk a little bit more about our thought out. Brilliant. Thank you very much now. And so in terms of looking at the outlook what I'm going to do first is talk a little bit about the market and then I'll talk about the balance of this half year. So in terms of the market obviously a big factor in the public sector market is the budget the various budgets we had so the change of government then the budget and then the spending review which was delayed from March this year through to June. And that's what gives departments sort of three years worth of money. And in the original spending review so the autumn budget and the spending review there were several cross-cutting initiatives and large investments that were put into those budgetary spends. So I've put up here on the slide I've just picked a few quite helpfully tech market view and did a nice little budget summary so it's well worth a look if you're interested in the digital transformation space and actually they've also written up our announcement today which is worth a look as well. But essentially the autumn budget that we've just had last week really sort of protected those commitments so there was nothing in those that budget update that causes us any concern in terms of this money being available. Now the new money in this comprehensive spending review actually becomes available from April next year. So what we are starting to see we're starting to see our pipeline both quality and size of deals improve. And I think that's partly the those funding that funding is starting to flow through to departments. In terms of where we sort of focus our attention there are three main areas. So placing infrastructure you would have seen on the pie chart that Noel showed. It's quite a high area for revenue for us at the moment. We've got some very large clients in there so we make CRG and his bachelor's land digital transformation partner and we're getting close to the high 10s getting close to 100 statements and work delivered with them. A transforming government really speaks to more of a cross departmental and cross arms length body and inter local government focus and that's really around the digital transformation space. And in health again we've made some investments recently we've got a new health partner that started because we see that as an opportunity area we see that as an area where there is more opportunity for us. Some of the work we've done over the past couple of years is very very good and very very strong and we'd like to see whether we compete that in more areas. So in terms of the market generally it feels very positive for businesses in digital transformation and I think we've seen that in terms of sort of the maintained rhetoric from government departments about the importance of digital transformation both to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of customer of citizen service delivery. So we've gone to the final slide so just to really round out what does that mean for this year? Client delivery that's obviously the anchor for all of our work and our activity. We have a high proportion of clients who we've had for many years and our current engagements continue to go well and extend which is a really positive sign. As I mentioned before pipeline quality we spent quite a lot of time sort of scrubbing the pipeline particularly having had a disruptive period through various elections and budgets and spending reviews of making sure that the opportunities in there are opportunities that we really want to be focused on. So they fit with our differentiation and the ones that we feel we have a good chance of being successful and based on our existing engagements we've got a pretty good line of sight for the rest of this year and particularly around EBITDA visibility and as a result of that we're confirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year of six to seven million and you can kind of see the trend that we've maintained on that from normal slides earlier over the past three years and because we're now in a position where we are generating a good level of adjusted EBITDA and we're managing our costs we're also generating cash so we're actually the board is adjusting its net debt target for the year so we we're signaling that will be below six million for the year so we've worth previously signaling it's going to be in the order of seven to eight million and that brings our leverage target down to one times so at the half year as Donald said previously it was 1.1 times and our previous guidance was in the range of 1.5 times to one times so what that really does is that gives us a really good platform a really solid business performance to look at the market is developing and to be successful in growing in that market so in summary we've executed and we are executing against our three-year plan sort of two and a half years into it into the final six months we will talk more about our ambitions for the business beyond that when we come back with a four-year result but that gives us a very firm foundation for growth over the next three years so that's about all we wanted to cover in the formal presentation we're really happy to answer any questions so I'll hand back four questions thank you great and I can see a couple in the window here okay so I want to go on the screen but I'll read them out so there was one around financial situation which we have a utilisation which I've come on to talk to so we had a pretty submitted question around our financial position and supporting a little bit of clarity on our current financial position and outlook hopefully it's pretty clear from the slides but the headline response to the question that was pre-signated around what's the health of our financial position is very healthy very secure and stable we agreed a new long-term debt facility with HSBC which are a banking bottom but for a long period of time we agreed that in the summer that's a three-year commitment with an extra two years to be added on if we wish and allows us to borrow everything that we need a more to meet our short-term capital equipments the business is profitable and cash generative and the net debt is falling as we've already talked about and our net debt is now going to be under six million is our target for the end of the year and less than one times leverage which is a five-person sort of seven and a half times leverage three years ago which is clearly unsustainable and I think as we already talked to we've got a pretty good backlog of work with existing customers stable and on-term relationships so it's a very stable position overall financially that we find ourselves in and start contrast to a few years here probably yeah and just to build on that if it if it helps with confidence when we when we bid for work and when we look at new opportunities we look to maintain pricing we look we have margin thresholds for bids and that's all to make sure that we've got the sort of the on having done all of this work to get the business where it is in the current financial position is in order to maintain that so hopefully hopefully that questions will answer yeah so then there's a question what steps did you take to improve your utilization presume you're using software to schedule your staff maybe I'll offer a couple of comments yeah that's good yeah so you know when we think about our utilization we're looking at our long-term skills to learn we're hiring people into skill areas that we think that continue to have long-term demand for clients we're obviously reskilling where possible if we see people with skills that are less relevant to the market I'm trying to give people a range of skills that will allow them to be busy on a variety of projects and clients over the long term and I guess the focus in terms of utilization is not just looking backwards but also looking forwards and making sure that the pockets of teams that have been busy for the last six months will continue to be for the next six to twelve months so I'm not sure there's one magic bullet to proving utilization of the continued management focus backwards looking and forward looking and to the point around I'm using software to schedule our staff we are we're actually spending some time effort and a small amount of money this year and part of which goes through our one-off restructuring and transformation costs related to implementing a new system built by a company called Sittini which is all about helping us manage resources schedule them in the future do scenario planning around existing margin of potential future margin for new skills we're quoting for so we came together live with that towards the end of the year and I think that will help the management of that further. No well probably only only one point you'll see that we have a mix of associates and permanent staff and subcontractors that mix towards associates went up slightly and that reflected some of the market uncertainty that we saw over the last 12 months or so and you'll also notice that we are recruiting we're actively recruiting for new permanent employees at the moment and that's across all of our delivery areas that's across design it's across product management it's for business analysts it's for data analytics specialist software engineers technologists and so we're sort of tweaking that a little bit and to sort of bring on more of our permanent teams but all of those recruitments we will always use an associate where there is a very specific skill set required for a particular client and it's not somebody that we can see long-term a long-term role for in TPS because that gives us lots of flexibility but wherever possible we will also invest in permanent employees and build our own teams yeah thank you so then there's a question of yours you might be better asked about you can you scale up enough to win large UK Gov jobs to the big IT consultancy players only asked by Brian T yeah so I guess there's a little bit about you know how big is that I guess one of the things that we've seen over the last three years is we've gone from a business that was originally winning and scaling up to deliver small single-digit million wins we then went through a sort of period particularly with mxclg what was called deluck in those times but again around the whole sort of housing at local government space of winning deals just shy of 10 million and then obviously as we've gone through there we've won deals our largest one is with land registry at 49 billion now that definitely did require a scale-up effort but it is something that we have done and we're positioned and able to do that and we're probably not in the reality we're not in the position where we could take on a you know 500 million pound contract or 250 million pound contract but there are plenty of very significant deals that we can before and that we can scale up effectively for we've we've done it before we've demonstrated we know how to do it and you know almost every day in our operations we get clients coming to us and they need a they need a squad which is kind of a multi-disciplinary team to be stood up very very quickly so it's a muscle that we're exercising virtually every day of the week yeah thank you so then there's a cover around different i'll just read it to make sure it's clear can you just can you clarify the difference to you know reported an adjusted profit another profitable now so i'll talk this through in the back of our press release it's sort of buried in the notes but there is a helpful reconciliation from reported operating loss to the adjusted even doubt that we talked to and so if i just call it out our operating offices gradually shrunk on a statutory basis as one as one would expect given he does improving so for the first half of this year there's a reported operating loss of 1.1 million and the bridge from that 3.2 million of EBITDA is 2.4 million of amortization in tangible assets so that's amortization linked to the accounting for acquisitions done in the past that amortization will continue to roll with a non-cash cost for us as a business so an accounting legacy of the acquisitions but not cash costs that we need to concern us as with we have about half a million of depreciation which is related to accounting for long term leases but we're generally pre-cap X light so that will remain fairly stable in the future and then we have 800k of 8,000 pounds of share base payments which relates to shown centric balance which is the right way for you to incentivize keep people across our teams and then we have 700,000 pounds of restructuring and transformation costs which is a combination of restructuring certain teams as and where we see the need and the implementation of the professional services tool that I talked about to help us manage resources and plan resources so that's the bridge it is in the notes in notes seven of the press release thing on to read through it but the short answer is yes we consider ourselves to be a profit business now we're paying tax which is the first time in a long time and we're doing all the new things one would do is profit business to keep costs under control and make sure that profit is moving in the right direction. There's one here for you, what trends we see in pipeline activity and conversion rates how are they comparing to pre disruption levels? Yeah I think in the release I talk about things normalizing which is essentially they're coming back to something that's a bit more familiar so one of the characteristics that we saw around the budget and then the run up to sorry the election and then run up to the budget when everyone was talking about the black hole last autumn and then up to the spending review in June is we saw lots of bid activity being severely delayed so we would have it's actually we're still waiting to hear on some things that have been delayed well over 12 months and so things slipped a long way in timing but also some things fell out of the pipeline because they'd get all the way down the pipeline and then there'd be a restructuring with the department and the requirement would go away with the view to come back later in the different form and we're certainly seeing a lot less of that we are still seeing some delays in the pipeline but we're seeing a lot more discussions around some of this new funding that I've been talking about and some of the new opportunities that will come through and it's fair to say that varies by different parts of government so where we've been you'll remember that we talk a lot about place and infrastructure that has been a pretty secure part of government to be in for the last six or 12 months so you can imagine we've got lots of existing and long-running engagements there so those have been you know very secure and we haven't had sort of reductions in terms of volume sort of pricing pressure on those so I guess in summary the pipeline is feeling more normal we scrub it really hard because it is a very expensive business to bid for these large government contracts so we've probably tuned up a little bit how hard we're scrubbing that pipeline to make sure that we're bidding for things that we really want to win and we think we're well positioned to win and we feel more on the yep this topic area as a question from Neil when you expect to return to revenue growth and I think which we'll have on the same subject it feels like we're making right investments in yeah sales and bid team marketing function alignment to set up that platform for growth so whilst we haven't put any revenue guidance out there for any commitment yeah so um look one of the principles that we've been working under is that we've been really focused on getting the business into good shape and on delivering the the sort of the restructuring elements and getting the business set up from that three scalable base and we are doing more to prepare ourselves for the next three years and that involves looking at the way we find new business so the new business development team the way that we look after our accounts our current clients both in terms of retaining those clients because obviously the easiest thing to do is to retain an existing client is even easier than winning a new client and how we grow within those clients and we've made some you know we continue to make changes in the business we've brought marketing team alongside our growth team so it's far more focused on early client engagement building those relationships positioning ourselves well we've made some changes in the bid team we've brought some new people in these people who actually write the proposals which is a really important part of working in government and we we're recruiting people I mentioned earlier on in the call I think about a new health partner we've brought in because we feel that's an area that you know we've probably been you know we could have done more but we can do more going forward so area where we're making a selective investment so these are really about sort of deploying our resources getting people lined up behind where we think the opportunities are new business in this first half we put some numbers into release they're a little bit shy still of where we were in FY24 but you know a lot of that comes down to these larger bids which can be you know pretty significant for us and we've got to be on the right side of the one or two percent that determines whether you're successful in your win or whether you come a close second and you end up with nothing so I think given where the market is we feel very confident about the market ahead we feel very confident that the business is set up well we're making some pragmatic changes around marketing new business development account management account retention and bidding process and a qualification process to sort of stack the odds in our favor yeah two thanks hopefully that answers the question so the next question is around AI and what's our position on AI if you have examples of work in the space I'm aware that it comes into a lot of our engagements I see in manifesto and obviously what we're doing in detail in discussions we have with coming to our offices but do you want to expand on that yeah absolutely um it's good questions thank you for that um there is actually something in the release there's a little but a little comment I put in there about using AI to support case case work delivery in a government area so that's a very typical use where you're using it to augment activity we have good representation good connections with government departments so about ten days ago we we had a lot of the sort of the AI technology leads from a lot of bigger government departments in our offices head office in the Hickman and though very much exchanging their experiences in the AI space and we were also lending our experience and and credibility there our positioning is that virtually on most of our large engagements AI plays a role in it we don't have many engagements which are purely AI engagement so it tends to be part of the delivery it'll be a statement of work or it'll be part to something that contributes to a statement of work our position very much is that because we are very familiar with the public sexual environment we understand the benefits that can be gained from more effective delivery of system services the efficiency benefits that we can gain but also the importance of maintaining data in a safe environment and using AI in an ethical way so I guess what we what we're seeing is there are a number of AI pilots going on across government we see it embedded into our engagements we don't see sort of people just when people don't just come and buy AI from us having said that you know from the client side in manifesto which is our digital experience agency a lot of the clients there are dealing with the challenges of how to operate with websites where they're trying to provide information perhaps for medical patients if they happen to be a medical charity and how to actually encourage people to get to website to get to the real information rather than just use the AI synthesized summary and not get to the website so our clients have some real challenges to navigate through the use of AI and the use of chat GPT by people and probably the final point is that we do use AI to augment our own delivery our business is very much a people-oriented business so our clients really benefit from our people working alongside their people so that person-to-person interaction is really key so we tend to use AI as an augmentation tool so to allow us to provide better products and better services and deliver those more effectively we do actually have a small AI data analytics solution that we provide through the Oracle cloud but that's really sort of for us that's a really good idea for us because it puts a toe in the water and allows us to see how other clients deal with those sort of solutions which helps inform our broader work so I think you know AI is here to stay in terms of the impact across government it's not something that we're going to sell as a standalone proposition and in really in a public sector context it's really important how we use it and so that's sort of ethical safe pragmatic approach that we've adopted since we go down really well perfect thanks Bjorn and I can see George has asked a bunch of questions we include AI so I think we've got that but thank you very much but to pick up George's other questions George's presentation any disclosure on revenue for the three divisions please we don't disclose that at the half year we do at the year end I think it's probably fair to say there's no material change in this bit of our revenue by segment compared to the year end so I hope that covers your question we talk about digital transformation a lot because it's the largest segment of our group and therefore it can make the weather but we're fairly comfortable with performances both manifesto and kits as well as that's said nice work on DSO management are there any lessons to draw out for the full year in working capital there's George's second question short answers there's nothing particular that I call out in terms of working capital we do the normal things in terms of collecting cash on a sensible basis we have the luxury of sensible government clients who pass very regularly without needing an awful lot of chasing so I wouldn't expect any large movements in both calculate the course of the financial year this year and there was then a question around AI which I think we've covered and maybe George your final question was I'll read it but it talks to restructuring and growth orientation I appreciate restructuring is more inward looking but in terms of making you more growth what do you have a must do list some of which we've talked about in terms of investing sales with it function yeah and George the comment I'd make on that because we said it on a couple of previous calls when we do look at the shape of the organization we do very much look outward because actually you know we take the perspective that we are there to serve our clients and meet our clients needs so therefore when we shape the organization so capitalized by the three brands if you like the three business units those are really designed around the customers that we're going to serve with those businesses and the best way of showing up to those customers and that pervades everything that we do you know every decision we make and we'll have an element of how does that help us how does that help our clients and how does that help us be more successful than winning new business or delivering for those clients so actually funnily enough very little of it is sort of inward looking it's mostly outward looking and how do we sort ourselves out to be you know as fit as possible for that external world yeah great okay and I think we're just probably moving into our last question now and then I'll ask you to give close and comments and ask Alex to help us wrap up and the question was is there any plan to restart dividends in the future the short answer is no when we think about capital allocation strategy as you've seen in terms of the group structure and what's changed over the last few years the important thing for us is to reduce our debt and that's because when investors look at us compared to maybe other IT services companies some of them have net cash and we are still carrying that debt so we want to remove any potential buying obstacle from new investors and we'd like to make ourselves as safe and credible as we can do so a short term capital allocation obviously is to focus on debt reduction as opposed to dividends as opposed to share buybacks which I don't anticipate in the near future and to the extent that we can contain our costs and do the things that we should do to make sure the operation is very lean in everywhere everywhere it can be them to use any of that money to fund investments in organic growth largely which will be tightly to sales and bidding and then I suppose the only thing that we may look at if we're in the nice position of having excess cash in future years is whether we look at modest M&A but I would say that our recent history doesn't give us the license to do lots of large M&A in the short term and we'd like to be in a position where the market believes that we're rated fairly compared to our peers and then we have a currency for acquisitions in terms of a healthy share price as well as cash in order to do that so I think that's still somewhere for us to build. All right so just to summarize I guess hopefully what you've heard today and you've heard consistently from us is that our main priority has been to establish a business that is very secure fundamentals so really good conversion of revenue through to a bit there are it's managed well you can see that on some of the slides we've taken you through in terms of the progression you can see the impact that has on our net debt position which has gone from you know what was frankly quite precarious position three years ago to a very very solid position now for a listed business and particularly compared to some of our private sector comparisons and we've done that whilst trying to maintain a real focus on our clients because we are a client serving business so maintaining that client delivery creating a great environment for our people there's been a lot of change in the business and it's a lot for a services business to go through so it's really important that we're coming towards the end of this sort of three-year plan with a well-shaped business as Noel's talked about we've got a few systems improvements that we're making at the moment which should help us work even more efficiently and more effectively with the market where it is currently it feels like the digital transformation market the demand is still there a sort of AI is turning to something that's a little bit more pragmatic and practical and it's permeating the work we do which is a good sign so it feels like we the markets in a reasonable place and it feels like we're fit in order and in a good position to both be a market so we're pretty pleased with where we are we're sort of you know sort of tweaks and changes in the business now are really oriented towards that growth dimension towards new business towards account management and account retention and we'll be talking a little bit more about what the next three years have installed for TPS Impact when we come back with our annual results so with that we'll hand back to Alex and thank you very much for your time really appreciate it fantastic if you want Noel thank you very much indeed for updating investors today could I please ask investors not to close this session as you know be automatically redirected to provide your feedback and although that the board can better understand your views and expectations this will only take a few moments to complete and I'm sure will be really valued by the company on behalf of the management team of TPS Impact Holdings PLC we would like to thank you for attending today's presentation and good afternoon to you all
