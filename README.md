Thank you very much and welcome to the conference call where we will present our first half financial results. It's a very special day for Kerning and Bauer and special day for myself as it is my first conference call in my new role as the CEO of Kerning and Bauer AG and also on my side the first conference call for our new CFO, Dr. Alexander Bloom. So it's a very special day but not only that, it's also a very unique day as we're broadcasting live from Frankfurt on mine and because it's a special day, we also have a special guest, our chairman of the supervisory board, Professor Dr. Raimun Klingner is also here and is joining today's call and we'll say a couple of introductory remarks and explain why today is so important. Thank you very much for your kind introduction and remarks. Good morning into the room, good morning in the virtual audience. I only would like to add some some information. In this year as you already mentioned and especially today we are celebrating remarkable anniversary milestones. As a company we are more than 200 years old to be precise, 208 years old and we had our 100th annual general meeting on the 4th of June in this year and today, exactly today, we are celebrating 40 years on the capital market. Looking back to these last 40 years, we moved more or less from a narrow focus on newspaper and bank not printing to global technology partner for broad scope of industries and substrates. That means continuous transformation and further development is core of our DNA and this also applies to our organizational development. With this year's already mentioned 100th annual general meeting, we completed the long planned and well orchestrated change of leadership, bringing Dr. Kimmesh into the CEO position. He is not new in the company but new in this role and with his step up into the CEO position. We, Dachma, we intentionally searched an external candidate, shaping the future operationally and of course it's not the task of the supervisory board to transport that to you. That were my introduction remarks to welcome you here in that special occasion and that special room and we are looking forward to exchanging with you our future. Thank you very much. So thank you for Professor Klingner and now we will move on to the more detailed presentation of our first half results in the format that you have become accustomed to at Kerning and Bauer in the previous years. ISCO will run through the highlights and they give you an overview of what's happened in the last few months at Kerning and Bauer and then Alexander Bloom will present in detail the financial figures and how we were able to close out Q2 just recently. So if you look at the business performance and Kerning and Bauer at a glance, we're very happy that we are able to present a strong second quarter. If you look back three months ago, the first quarter we were very confident we tried to explain to you and the capital markets that we are on track but you couldn't quite see it in our P&L and we had to explain and that there were some temporary effects in Q1 that covered up the operating improvements that we knew were there. In Q2, you can clearly see our operating improvement. We're able to strengthen our operating performance significantly over the prior year and I think you'll be able to see in the next 40 minutes that we're on track and the profitability improvements that we need are coming. We'll talk a little bit today about our new focuses where we're focusing in the company and I will show that in a couple of pages. What has happened in the first half of this year, I think one of the other significant announcements recently is that part of our strategy is focus. Kerning and Bauer is a very broad portfolio and we have to focus on doing what we have, bring it to the market and make it more profitable. So in doing this, we look through our portfolio and decided to initiate a project for reviewing the future alignment of Kerning and Bauer coding GMBH. It's one of our many subsidiaries. It's in a very unique business position in coding and the synergies with the rest of the group are not particularly high which is why we put this into the market for discussion on our future strategy. We also had two big market developments in the last three months. We had the China print in May which was one of the two largest trade shows in Asia where we were able to successfully book a lot of business and we also see with the print for all another trade show in Italy and the Italian government support programs and subsidy programs that we were able to book significant orders in southern Europe in the last few months so that overall our top line and our order backlog continues to look good. We're making progress in digital printing. I'll also talk about this later. We also made great progress in our cooperation with Volkswagen where we officially announced already at the General Assembly in June that we have made good progress with our dry coding, battery dry coding development project. We successfully closed out the proof of concept and that project continues. And finally what we'll talk about today is a large program which I think every company is looking at and every company is starting initiatives but Kerning and Bauer is really going all in on getting our company up to speed and state of the art in the future of artificial intelligence and what it means for internal processes and what it means for our products and our customers. If we look at the figures, order intake was slightly down over the previous year but please remember last year was a droopa year. Sorry, I wasn't quite finished with that slide. Apologies for the quick disruption. Order intake was down over the previous year but please remember last year was a strong cue too in due to droopa and therefore we're quite happy with our order intake in this year where book to bill was again greater than one which is always a good sign for capital goods. Revenue was up which we did not have after the Q1 figures so now year to date revenue was up and EBIT as mentioned a significant operating improvement in our profitability which Alexander Bloom will talk about in a second. Also in networking capital we continue to show year on year improvement as we have in the past. Overall in both our segments we show positive revenue development and in special new technologies a continued you'll see year on year a slight weakness in order intake particularly on the digital printing solutions which have a strong US focus. Overall I think the key message today is that we're on track. We confirm our guidance for this year. We confirm that we're absolutely generating the savings that we had intended on our spotlight program and we see ourselves on a path to have a strong 2025 and a significant improvement over last year. So I've moved now into just the highlight on the figures. I think the main focus on this page is really just the order backlog on the top left 1.096 billion euros of order backlog. The highest figure in the youngest or the most recent corporate history of Kearney and Bauer. We seem to be moving from one peak to one to the next peak to the next peak. We've made that statement three times I think in the last 18 months that we're at the historic highest order backlog and that's again the case at 1.096 the third time we've broken the record in the last six quarters. Great news for us in a very uncertain times that we have a lot of tailwind from order backlog to support us in the coming quarters as the impact of the tariffs and the global economic uncertainty plays out. Everything else I've mentioned book to build good revenue up year on year and operating EBIT also a significant improvement now into two prior year. So next few minutes I'll talk more about the business highlights and I've presented a slide at the general assembly but just to give you a feeling of how the new board is approaching Kearney and Bauer and where we intend to have our focus. If you look back in the last decades we've done a lot. I'm thankful for all of my predecessors the last 40 years and particularly here the last 25 years that we've handled the disruption to our print industry quite well. A huge age of diversification where we enter new markets with M&A we develop our own new products and we spent the last five years in in very difficult times pandemies energy crisis wars supply chains energy shocks etc. Really finishing out this portfolio completion the diversification spin-offs new products but we spent a lot of effort and a lot of money getting these products and getting into these diversified markets and getting ready to scale and now our focus very clear it's about performing it's about making Kearney and Bauer more profitable it's about getting these products that we finished getting these new businesses that we've started giving them into the market scaling the business and moving the company forward profitably. We're going to have five focus points I'll talk about this again in previous at the general assembly and it will be a focus on our capital market today. Today on the right it's about go to market Kearney and Bauer has a very broad portfolio it's not dogmatic that we say we're never going to do anything new but the general message is focus on the portfolio we have and getting it more profitable and into the market and scaled. Second it's about competitiveness I am a huge fan of Germany and German competitiveness and I'm confident that we'll be able to compete on a global scale but it requires work it requires thinking differently and it requires a lot of focus on competitiveness in terms of improving processes and improving costs improving structures. Resilience as the third major topic in volatile times we have to become more flexible we have to work on our structures to become more more adaptable and to become faster in adapting to change resilience in terms of financial resilience operating resilience and supply chain resilience is something that I think all industrial companies need to improve on in the coming years to to emerge from these kinds of crises even stronger and finally intelligence intelligence means artificial intelligence for ourselves for our customers but also means finding solutions to help our customers and to help our our staff worldwide to to face the challenges coming forward and that all even if customer first I mentioned last it's deliberate because these fear points four points are all under the mantra of our customers in focus it's the strength of cutting of our for 208 years and developing with our customers and making our customers more successful ensures our success as well. Moving on to the next page I go through a few of the more detailed business highlights our spotlight program that we announced in I believe Q2 last year is absolutely fully on track it's nearing completion in terms of implemented savings you see it in the year-on-year improvement Q2 versus Q2 it's our digital web project in Wertzburg banknote metal print and are reducing our holding costs we had again a small amount of extraordinary charges in Q2 that we had announced and and you should be should have been expecting overall the program is nearing its full completion and full implementation and this is what's driving our profitability improvements year-on-year and will also drive further profitability improvements in 2026 compared to 2025 and also of course part of the holding cost reductions is streamlining management streamlining the executive board and reducing from five to two which is now operatingly fully implemented and until end of the year we remain three but the the path to two is already clear for 2026. On the next page I already mentioned in my highlights we've decided to approach the market for future for a new alignment of our kerning about our coding business coding subsidiary this is less than five percent of the kerning about our turnover but it is a very nice business it's profitable it's successful it's growing it's got 300 employees that have been dedicated to this business for decades we're happy with it but we recognize one kerning about is a very complex company with a very broad portfolio and number two kerning and bower coding if you look at all of our businesses across the entire spectrum kerning about our coding has the smallest overlap with the rest of the business it instead of where we are either focusing on banknotes or on packaging manufacturers so the company's making packaging coding is focusing more on the companies that are filling the packages they're focusing on industrial applications like industrial cables tires it's just it's a different market different customers different sales channels and the overlap both technology and from the market is simply the smallest of any of our businesses and in under our overall philosophy of more focus in the company and more resilience in the company we've announced last week that kerning about our coding is is under investigation for its new alignment what that means is open whether it means new strategic partnerships join ventures where we give up part of our shares or a full sale of 100 percent of the shares to a new buyer to a new owner that's open but the basic messages we're realigning this business going forward and I think it's clear that that's in line with the rest of our strategy and our main focus going forward I mentioned already on the next page the china print and print for all in Italy these were two major trade shows and you'll see I mentioned already booked to bill 1.2 highest order intake of all time also driven by two markets it's not only about the US you'll see in the backup that our US sales are significantly down year on year but overall sales are up and this means also focusing on new markets it means not just being overly reliant on one region so great successes in china during china print and I can only reiterate the italian industrial support from the from the italian government has really led to a boom in 2025 for demand for our machines from Italy combined with the trade fair in Milan we were able we announced that we had over 50 million euros of order intake just in Italy one country in one quarter so I think this slide is really meant to show we're in a global market we have you know 83 percent 85 percent export and being successful in markets across the world is another key to our success as a company on the next page on page 11 a short reminder that we have a very broad portfolio in many different packaging markets and we now have digital solutions for all these markets whether it's folding carton corrugated metal print or here also glass printing we are the market leader in glass printing for traditional silkscreen direct to glass printing and very quietly without a lot of press and media we now have nearly 20 machines installed for glass digital glass printing at curtain of our common you see one series here with Johnny Walker directly printed on the glass every one of these labels it's not really a label because it's directly printed is unique it's a it's a last year with Louis Vuitton has something similar we won a lot of awards because this is a very difficult process and a very difficult three-dimensional shape to to three-dimensional shape to print on we've done it we've done it well and we've done this also not because we have to do everything ourselves I think you've seen many times in the past the curtain of ours very good at corporations we're very good at partnerships we don't have to do everything ourselves and this is an example in one of our other small subsidiaries also less than 5% of curtain and bower now becoming the leader in digital printing on glass as an example of our flexibility and our ability to evolve the business on page 12 as already presented at the general assembly we also announced in Q2 that we successfully achieved the next milestone of our cooperation with Volkswagen for the dry coating the machine for the dry coating of battery cells this is still a development project it now moved to the next phase and now it's about scaling together with Volkswagen PowerCo and we've now finalized the commercial framework agreement between the parties and move into the next phase I can't tell you today when will that next phase be announced but at the end we've now been in roughly two years in this cooperation and we keep moving from milestone to the milestone and successfully pushing the project forward and I would also remind a lot of talk today about diversification in the markets and how do companies move into new markets this is a great example of how curtain and bower takes its core know-how in this case out of bank no business and applies it to new markets but this project is moving along quite nicely whether it's successful in the industrial in the industrialization and the scaling remains to be seen but we're clearly moving forward page 13 and I'm almost done with the highlights AI in power so we kicked off internally a massive training program for enabling a large portion of our employees and using our AI tools we have a partner with Google since many many years for Google workspace and for Google BigQuery Google data warehousing for a lot of our digital products and Google Gemini as their AI tool is integrated in our every employees work space that they have access to it but how to use it also Gemini Advance no book L.M other Google tools we're training over 500 of our 5200 employees are getting intensive training they have been for a couple months so that roughly 10% of our workforce will be intensively trained on how to use AI internally for processes even Dr. Bloom and myself get trained on the use of AI Monday this week as a small little example we spent an hour and a half with Google for the second time learning how does AI work in detail and how can you use it and what does it mean for companies like curtain and bower it's a massive project even within these 500 we've defined a smaller group of champions that get even more training and more intense so how to get AI knowledge into the company and get a multiplicator effect into the employees and figure out what does it mean for our internal processes on top of that we have in our curtain about our Kiana spinoff that is existed since April 1st 2025 is the other question of how do we use AI for our products for our machines for our customers again in partnership with Google and other partners led by Sandra Wagner who also present this afternoon our capital markets day it's an ecosystem for our customers how to use any information on our machines whether it's training manuals machine data benchmarking among among customers energy management it's how to use AI in our digital solutions and this is something we are already scaling and already into the market with this is not just future products these products are now sold to customers being used by customers and is a large part of our strategic focus going forward so that is it for me as the 20 minute introduction in terms of cutting a bower at a glance and what are the business highlights that have happened in the last three or four months for those of you that attend our capital market day this afternoon we're of course going to have a deep dive in many of these topics that we talk about more and have more members of management to present but that being said thank you for listening I will hand over to Alexander balloon who will walk you through the financial figures and then we'll open up for Q&A thank you thank you Steven good morning ladies and gentlemen it's my great pleasure to present to you for the very for my very first time the the first quarter results of cleaning and bower and it's also not only a pleasure to present this numbers but it's a true pleasure to be on board of this fantastic fantastic company later on during our capital market stay we are happy also to show you some further insights in the future strategy but let's now start with finally some numbers some financials as as dr kimmy already has stated the order intake is a little bit down on a year-on-year basis by minus four point five point four percent but considering the macro economical level that we had considering the state that we last year had the troop of fair this is is a good a good result and is offering us a very good basis revenues we are increasing this is part of our our cross strategy cross initiatives and also part of the guidance for this year and the order backlog is on a on a fantastic level of nearly 1.1 billion billion euros with regard to to operating profitability and and EBIT the EBIT increased tremendously on a year-on-year basis plus 20.1 percent this year compared to last year you can see the where what are the drivers behind behind this increased profitability increase one driver is is higher higher avenues and an increase of volume but the other one which is even greater is the the operating effects which consists out of a mix a product price mixture but also on savings with regard to function costs savings with regard to our to our cost of good souls of our production costs and this is also the the reflection and the the constant positive consequence of our spotlight program from the from the recent past you also see that our non non-operating effects increase decreased which is a good result because last year with nine million euros of non-operational effects this was a quite quite high number this year we only see one four point two million euros so that is a this is a significant decrease and also good result you see on the very right hand corner the operating EBIT adjusted for two costs which is offering you a view on the operational performance of the company and also with regard to this this KPI we increased our profitability by by over 15 million euros a year on year on the next page you find the Q2 numbers on the one hand you see the increase in revenues compared to to last quarter last year quarter by plus plus seven percent you see the increase in order backlog by over seven percent and you see on the bottom line the three KPI's of EBIT which also show big big big big step of improvements why three indicators just to make it very clear because maybe in the past this could have been a little bit confusing on the on the left hand side you find the reported EBIT according to IFRS that includes basically everything and there you see that we achieved a positive EBIT in Q2 stand alone this year by 0.4 million euros it's an increase by plus 24.1 million euros in the middle column you find the operating EBIT also according to IFRS which is which is deducting all the non-operational effects and there you also find a positive number for this year's quarter of 1.8 million euros and on the very right hand side you find the comparison especially with an with an adjusted basis of 2024 by the two per costs and also with regard to this KPI you still see an increase in an increase of profitability of over 16 million euros and that is for critic and Bauer within recent years in history a very good step forward and at the end we also talk about the guidance but you know we have confirmed our guidance for 2025 on the next slide and this is a new a new presentation you find the the LTM operating EBIT so last 12 months level is also showing nice indications it's a showing a trend level which you can see here and it also shows that the operating performance after or before the depreciation amortization is increasing even stronger as on on the level of EBIT and it also shows a positive trend over the last quarters what you see is that our profitability level is now above 2023 and you can also see that we have reached an EBITDA margin of of 6.5 percent on the basis of last 12 months so that is something which is also which is also bringing up confidence to us that the operational performance and the profitability level of our company is improving and the development is absolutely in the right in the right direction with regard to the full P&L VF already presented the most important KPI's to you just let me let me state on two two more two more two more lines of the P&L one is the the administrator administrative costs which show an increase year on year this is due to overall price increases like like leasing and rents which we show which we see in the market unfortunately and it's an and shift in provisions this is not an expression that we are that we are stepping down from our strategy of a lean lean structure and a lean company but it is as impacts which are on the market and which just belongs to bookings and and and provisions but not on a shift on on on on productivity or on on the on our focus strategy and on our strong belief that we want to be a leaner leaner company and and have a leaner structure the second line which might be of interest is the financial result which increased by by a small amount compared to last year and this is due to a higher utilization of our accrual line and the higher accruals that we had to hand out is due to the higher order backlog so it is more money involved but it's a positive sign it also says that we have this strong order backlog which we utilize for our for our further growth we also see some some positive trends with with regard to our to our interest rates paid for the bank loans and liabilities of course they're the the eurobor is decreasing on the one hand but on the other hand the premium interest the premium margin that we are paying as quenigan bower is is decreasing as well due to a better position of ourselves within our margin grids due to a lower leverage level which lever leverage ratio which we were able to achieve on the next page you'll find some some key indicators with regard to cash and and working capital and the free cash flow looks of course not positive on on on a year-on-year comparison but it is due to a big big increase in our working capital last year in the cash flow 2024 there was an decrease of working capital and therefore a cash in of of over 20 million euros this year we have compared to the end of last year we have increased our working capital by over 50 40 million so it has a cash out of minus 40 and this difference between plus 20 last year minus 40 this year is more or less the whole development of our of the of our cash flow this year compared to last year you see on the on the lower left hand side the networking capital position and even though we have a strong increase in in the first half of 2025 we were able to decrease our overall our overall networking capital position by by by nearly 20 million euros and we also increased it on a relative terms to up to a level or down to a level of 26.3 percent so this is the right tendency and my my my my colleagues have started in the past an intense intensive discussion about cash and working capital and how we how we allocate our resources and this is something which is also one of the most striking points for me and and most important topics in future for Koenig and Bauer to have a very close look and our cash positions on our liquidity and also with regard to working capital to be and become more and more efficient over time the equity is is is still over 300 million euros with an equity margin of of nearly 20 with an equity ratio of nearly 23 percent so there we are still on a on a good level the the decreases of course to the to the net loss that we have achieved in the first half of the year but we are still on a considerably good good amount. With regard to the to the crew cash flow statement let me emphasize two more two more points to you and first of all the the cross cash flow improved significantly by the better result that we were able to achieve this year compared to last year the cash from operating activities that is changing due to an increase in working capital and also due to the comparison of of last year's cash flow which had an decrease of working capital and you also can see the investing activities this year are below the level of last year and this is due to a very good investment story in the last in the last years and now Koenig and Bauer is in a position to profit and to benefit from the cap expense in the last year so we can deliberately lower our our our our level of of necessary investments even though to be prepared for the future on the one hand and on the other hand of course it is our our constant task and drop to to be to be very careful with with our capital expenditures and to save our liquidity in on a on an appropriate level. With regard to balance sheet on the next page there you find all the details but maybe we can like let me pound out for my for my specific topics to you the decrease in our tangible and intangible assets is is due to a lower lower capex level this year the the current assets are slightly below the level of last year by minus 2.8 million and there's a mixture of effects which we see we see an increase in inventories we see an increase in our financial receivables which is belongs to our receivables towards our joint venture with the company doers for digital printing we see an increase of the other assets which is a result of the POC accounting especially with the bank node solution business higher prepayments for our suppliers due to the strong order backlog and due to an increase of other taxes on the one hand on the other hand we see of course a bigger decrease in our cash position which is bringing the occur the overall current assets position a little bit down the development of our equity is due to the to the net loss of of the period and the small decrease of our pension provisions and similar obligations is due to an increase in the discount rate by 0.3 basis points last but not least our bank liabilities there you see a shift between the current liabilities current bank liabilities or current financial abilities and the non-current liabilities bank liabilities by roughly 40 million but this is not due to a change in our financing structures or this is not due to a change in the due dates this is only an expression of our our own sentiment of our own planning how we will decrease the the bank liabilities until year end last but not least have us let us have a closer look to our to our two segments on the next page on the next page ah there we go thank you very much paper packaging and and special and new technologies the order intake of of paper packaging is nearly at the level of last year and this is this is a very very positive um positive news because last year there has been the big trooper fair this year there was no trooper but nevertheless um paper packaging order intake on the same level with regard to order backlog it's a little bit lower but with regard to order intake it's on the same level and the order backlog is is also lower because revenues have been increased in the in the segment paper packaging compared to last year with regard to special and new technologies it looks a little bit different um the order intake is a little bit lower compared to last year this is due to the situation that we had last year a lot of other intakes from the from the american state for the bureau of of printing and engraving from the of course this year the the order intake is a little bit lower so that's why the order intake decreased on a year-on-year level comparison but the order backlog um it has has has strongly increased compared to last year and this is also due to the fact that we are still working on on these on these big orders from from the past with regard to revenue we we see a small increase on a year-on-year basis with regard to profitability the positive effect is that the the the profitability within both segments could have been improved on a year-on-year basis on the next page um allow us a little a little summary of the current situation with regard to uniforms customs and tariffs um i think that is a topic which is um which is striking to all of us and to a lot of to a lot of companies um what we see right now is that there is the cap on tariffs of our machines of 15 percent um and hopefully there won't be a shift anymore um after after the deal the deal was made so on the one hand we see the plus 15 percent and on the same time we also seen uh we see a change in the f in the fx rates euro to us dollar which has you all know this um the the the dollar is weaker right now so with regard to to foreign exchange rates it is also a second effect which makes our machines more expensive for us customers and now we have two the two ends of the same equation uh the positive thing is that we have uh no more uncertainty or that there we have much more clarity with regard to customs that is positive on the other hand we see an increase in the prices or we see it it is more expensive due to the increased tariffs on the one hand and the and the change fx rates um on the other hand so which effect will be more stronger that is the existing or the exciting question for the future and that is something which we will observe very closely within the next within the next months and that brings us also to our to our outlook for this year and uh and and and and our midterm guidance um we are absolutely convinced that we can confirm our guidance and that we will receive and achieve our guidance of 2025 we will see a slight increase of revenues of um one of two 1.3 billion and we definitely see an increase in the operating abit to a range of of 35 to 50 million euros and once we have achieved that step will be also further big improvement with regard to to the last year and also a very big step in the right direction for Koenig and Bauer we will also we also confirm our strategic outlook um we are aiming um up to revenues of up to 1.5 billion with an operating abit margin of of five to six percent that is our ambition level and we see that this is is is positive is is positive is is possible we also will see a further increase within profitability in the next year compared to to this year compared to 2025 however a more precise guidance on the next year um due to the uncertainties due to the developments also with regard to tariffs with regard to the to um the trade and the business with the US um we we cannot give you today but we will give it to you at a very um at a near point in future um latest beginning of the next year. So thank you very much thank you Alex I think that that closes out the presentation of our business highlight and the financial figures and now we hand over back to the operator for um I'm sorry we stay here in the room I apologize we're first going to stay here in the room if there's any questions here in Frankfurt regarding our H1 figures so again just please raise your hand and our microphone will be brought to you we start here with Mr. Odenaika from Barabank yeah and because the operator will not announce your names I mean I know all of you I think but still I'd be happy if you're going to please introduce yourselves and then answer the question or ask the question yeah uh Peter Odenaika from Barabank uh first question on on order intake um so order intake in the second quarter was was quite good given the high basis last year sorry here Odenaika regarding the bit numbers in neodron regarding security sprinting and digital and web so you do not separate anymore but can you give us some information how did digital and web perform in relation to to security sprinting in the second quarter sure um we can jump in the back up a slide slide two off the back up there you find the the digital dev business unit as a breakdown of our of our segment S&T and what you can what yes this one thank you very much and there you see that we that we are phasing and a decrease in order intake with the digital and web business um and this is due to um the business that we are doing within this business units with with Hewlett packet USA so this is a direct impact and the most direct impact we are phasing due to the situation with with with tariffs um and we can unfortunately um directly link it to to the to the US it's also a water jet i want to explain okay you do the rotor jet um but let me let me also um show you one one other big improvement this is on the level of e-bit even though we have a decline in revenue year on year in the segment due to the lower increase to due to lower in order intake and due to lower business with the US um we also see an improvement within our profitability and that is a good good good sign as well of course it is still in on a level which is absolutely not appropriate but clinic embawa and the business unit and the business is developing in in the right direction i would only add that it's uh softening in the business in general the the large digital printers is both the hp business and the rotor jet um the largest we have installed base for those big massive digital printers is to a large degree in the US the US has been adopting those products faster and uh that's certain soft certainly softened a lot in the last six months that hits us both on the on the ordering take side and on the revenue side because we have we have pocket counting but uh um we promised you when we re-segmented that we would continue to publish the digital web results for um a certain amount of time for transparency reasons so that's why they will always remain in the backup and uh you can see you can see we still have quite a lot of work to do but um we've already done a lot of work um my next question is on free cash flows or in the first half of the year you're very strongly negative what is your expectation for for the full year do you expect positive free cash flow for 25 yes you know with us you expect us similar last year we promised last year we would have by end of the year we expect positive cash flow still a lot of work to do obviously um but that commitment we given Q1 that we expect a full year positive cash flow and it still stands we have a lot of working capital to support our strong second half of the year it's a seasonality effect that we are facing right now um which is which is also to one reason it is also due to the higher order backlog and um also the the the strong h2 h2 that we are looking looking ahead to um but at the year end also with the improved profitability cash flow should be on the same level at least as last year or cash position and my last question is on security sprinting particular with your big customer in in the US do you have here some some statement to to what extent have said the tariffs and the fx situation some some impact here on demand um both we can say none so the tariffs is fully covered by the customer that's already contractually agreed and we have also received the first reimbursements of tariffs after importing so it's it's also working it's not just a paper um and second we we told you already in Q1 that we had executed a very large hedge for us dollars that was one of the reasons we had a temporary affecting Q1 um that that drove down profitability a little bit um so we feel comfortable on the fx rate for at least um I would say 2026 and into 2027 so please honest please when he puts capital maybe following on to us you showed it's important end market for you can you explain us a little bit more how important the market is it had been regal ready in the first half compared to last year and it was 23 and was 28 percent in the in the full year in the first half um how important is the market and what do you see maybe seem to your competitors how your position is now I think there is no major printing machine producer in the US I'm not aware of it they are coming from Europe and Japan but maybe party of China now in the low end but how you see your positioning going forward now so for how easy it is maybe to give the tariffs to the customer and so on the little bit more insight and how profitable this activity was at the past was it above the average or below the average sure it knows a great question I mean the US is very important for us for I think for all export companies it's a massive market it's the largest export market in the world and if you look also in the backup in in terms of revenue last year in 2024 it was significantly higher than now in 2025 so it's disappointing that the free trade is under pressure and um that the tariffs have hit as well as the exchange rate issue that with 30 percent more expensive machines going into the US in dollars we expect obviously a decrease in demand um what you can obviously see in our order intake is that we're very capable in transitioning to other markets and and selling our machines into new markets particularly in Asia and China I think in my personal opinion this overall disruption we see through protectionism throughout the world leads to a diversification of production throughout the world so that is driving investment or one in one of the other countries you see a lot of Chinese companies investing heavily outside of China building up capacities in Southeast Asia or in Latin America so it is driving reactionary investments in other parts of the world and I think that's certainly one driver of our successes in Southeast Asia and China we have to see US is important it's not only just the sales it's also traditionally a country that invests in high-tech it invests in the most advanced machines it invests in digital printing and tends to be on the forefront of productivity so it's not just mix we're able to compensate that quite well but I think we mentioned already in Q1 margins are under pressure and payment terms even payment terms of Chinese and Asian companies are typically with letters of credit not as attractive as traditional Western payment terms um the machines are a little bit less automated a little bit more basic so it means the margins are perhaps not as not as strong or the price point per machine is not quite as strong it's a shift that we can manage and we are managing it's part of our job and it's part of our daily business but the real answer is it's again the US is important and we have to find the answers there from the competitive position we're quite comfortable as you mentioned none of our major competitors are in the US they're all in Europe in Switzerland or in in Japan and as you also mentioned Chinese competitors are more in low-end and not directly competing with us so it's not about market share it's more about the market itself and how will the US market develop and we're quite again with 1.08 billion euros of order backlog or nearly 1.1 billion euros of order backlog we're comfortable moving into the next quarters um but free trade would be better be very short for long um in your CIM system how has the pipeline been developed had been the pull effects it don't look like but uh have you seen any impact on on the pipeline because of so we have it's a very good question as well um it's not that we're losing projects so the customers are just stopping and saying you know just so the projects are still alive the decision time frame is taking longer so the time between opening up a a tender or a project with a customer and getting the decision is certainly taking longer um then it used to um we had a lot of contracts that were ready to be signed that the customer said that's let's wait let's wait maybe the tariffs go away and um because as mentioned we passed through the tariff store customers so um we had quite a few customers saying we think the 10's gonna go down or the think the 30's gonna go down and it's wait wait wait um um I think that basically answers the question those are the um yeah we will see you know I mean the pipeline itself I guess that maybe one last comment comment um it's not shrinking it's taking longer and we are still booking orders in the US it's face the last major comment I should I should repeat um it's not that the market's gone it's I would even say it's it's it's down to covid levels are just you know disappeared it's it's still there the US is it's a rich country it's um they also have it's not just about tariffs they have a clear onshoring strategy in the US to that we can find good or find bad but we are placing order our customers are placing orders we are selling machines and the pipeline is there it's certainly not as robust as I think back 2023 2024 the US was just booming and that's not the case in 2025 let me add at one point maybe um our our American colleagues are very optimistic so maybe they tend to be more optimistic than the Germans but at the end it's a 1 million million euro question um how is how how are the tariffs now the new situation will will turn out and how it will affect the business second question to your coding business which under review if I'm totally not totally wrong your new uh major shareholder mr. Leibinger's ordinance is business are you in contact with him about this topic um as a shareholder and we have to ask him if he has any intent in that direction but the two topics have nothing to do with each other coding was was on our list of potential new alignment long before we had uh changed our shareholder structure um and now the decision is also completely independent of any shareholder structures um but of course there may be discussions um in that direction the future but you have to ask um our investors are not me you see an active investor sorry you see an active investor maybe push you to do things or is he only on the side I think very supportive of a strategic investor um I think active the way I would define it is at general assemblies and in meetings I think that's not the case um but we're very happy to have a strategic investor on board um in these difficult times and we see it as a commitment to german industry and it's a good sign for us and finally to your fully outlook um it looked first ambition to have a sequential growth of 35 percent but last year it was even a little bit stronger and you had the same you plan now for 750 million and now you expect the same is it prudent given your high audit backlog or environment yet to expect it's the same figure as last year or is it even maybe optimistic given such environment is so so difficult and you have to cherish now and so on so only a little bit compared to I think it's really guiding for a flat revenue compared to last year um I mean a second half of last year was very strong indeed and we expected to be very strong this year again um the overall guidance from our point of view is absolutely realistic but the second again a very strong second half year is of course ambitious that's normal for us and including a bower proved it very well last year that they are able to achieve and um to realize the goal and to this year again the same the same the same ambition level I would only agree after in my six-year kerning and bower so we're very confident that we'll be able to execute Q 2 or a second half of the year as as in our guidance implied um we know how to do it we've done it many times um and we also would prefer a much more front loaded year and not have to chase chase it towards Christmas but um we know we can do it last year was extraordinary we had a lot of things that's that that that went from eight the first half of the year into the second half of the year so that kind of double loaded the second half of the year um so I wouldn't just take the second half of the year plus the first half of this year and just add them together it's going to look a little bit different this year but we're going again so as we're sitting here I hope we make a relatively relaxed impression we're confident in this guidance and our ability to execute yeah thanks a lot a fellow hortle thalet from chowcat of houser um so I would like to go back um uh to the frickas flow and and the spotlight uh so it was not clear very clear to me looking to the increase of the administrative cost if you already had a good support from a spotlight this quarter that would be my first question I see that they're in digital and and and the back notes and meant you have a strong improvement but if I know I don't know if it's related to the catch up in the second quarter with the accounting of bang notes uh cells or if you already had a big support that would be my first question we we had definitely a big support from from the from the recent program spotlight and you maybe can see it on the best way if you look at the e-bit bridge um on page 16 um there you there you have um operating effects positive effects in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year of over 10 million euros of nearly 11 11 million euros and that of course is also part of part of spotlight um the volume effect is lower because of the current situation but the operating effects is even higher and and that is the main driver behind the increase in profitability that we are that we are facing today um and this is also of course um partly due to due to spotlight and can you give us some hint of what is the run rate per quarter of savings that you're going to have from now on offline um this is difficult to say because spotlight originally was also for our financing partners measured in a very special way first of all it only showed the it did not show the net savings but only the cross savings and secondly it was always compared to the basis end of 2023 so this measurement and this calculation is absolutely correct and it is also audited by and by an external expert um but it is difficult to say how this translates into the through the current numbers that you see in the financial report also with regard to the comparison of last year so what we prefer is um to to show you the direct impacts that we see on a year on year basis and which you also can find directly in our financial reports maybe in another way do you have more additional savings coming in the second part of the year or do you have achieved most of the plan no we achieved we have achieved the majority of the plan the base majority of the plan but we still um we still expect some more savings in the second half of the of this year the second half of 2025 due to spotlight okay because following following that question I see that you have reviews substantially the provisions this means that the outflows related to the spotlight have been also completed so you have already paid for the more than the reviews of the FTEs and all that yes correct okay okay and maybe a follow-up on on the on the North America topic the tariffs and the order intake so is there a way you can give us a hint or idea of where is the cycle for seed fed in North America and also I'm interested in Germany to a little bit um have a clearer picture where we are if you take obviously the good news in Italy the good news in China and I think the sales are not going to show us the the uh clear view on where we are in North America because you have the bank notes we are already at a low uh cycle in North America and in Germany and this can improve from now on or and US is just a big question nobody knows um when or if or how it's going to develop that's really I think nobody has a crystal ball and anybody who claims to know it I think I would uh approach with a lot of skepticism um Germany is still weak slightly improving it's getting a little bit better but I certainly know you you who effect there um in general I wouldn't say seed fed is I mean seed fed is the largest part of our company but the reliance in the US is similar to the group it's the group in general we see the biggest impact in digital and web which you saw earlier with the big digital machines where the order in backlog is down sheet fed is is having perhaps the again the stable development in the US considering the circumstances and it's also sheet fed that was driving the Italian and China um uptick that's mostly coming from that paper and packaging sector um but there's no business that's not doing business with the US I mean we're we're exposed across all of our businesses to the US market I would only I would only repeat I think the sheet fed is robust um digital web is suffering a little bit more again on top of all the other topics but um I think the time is up you have one maybe 30 seconds or if you I can I can add some questions later if you want yeah so we don't have any questions in the call I was just received the message and it is exactly 12 o'clock so we are very punctual but that was the plan so thank you very much for joining our first half conference call for the June 30th results it was a pleasure as for me the first time as CEO to finish the figures thank you for your attendance I look forward to seeing on many of you I hope at one o'clock at our capital markets day and uh discussing further so thank you very much and good afternoon and the operator you can close the call thank you thank you
