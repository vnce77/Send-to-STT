Hello everyone and welcome to the MLC Q2 2025 earnings call. My name is Emily and I'll be coordinating your call today. After the presentation you will have the opportunity to ask any questions by pressing star followed by the number one on your telephone tree path. I would now like to turn the call over to test Goldstalk to begin. Please go ahead. Thank you and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2025 results call. During the call we refer the information provided a second quarter 2025 press release, MD&A, an interim consolidated financial statements, all of which were released Thursday evening and are available on our website and on CDAR. Joining me this morning to discuss our results and add look for the business is our Chief Financial Officer Nikita Klossen, our President Henry Long, and our head investor relations Scott Chan. As a reminder all references to dollar amounts on this call are US dollars unless otherwise stated. Overall we made progress on key business initiatives during the quarter and remain confident in the direction of the business and we are looking forward to sharing more about that with you today. We're also pleased to announce that we're paying our 24th consecutive quarterly dividend which consists of a 2 cents 2 Canadian cents per share distribution for shareholders of record as of August 19th 2025. As a reminder during the first quarter we announced a transformative all-stop accommodation with 180 degrees capital or a turn which remains subject to the regulatory and shareholder approvals. We filed a joint proxy statement with the SEC around a proposed combination and the proxy materials were declared effective on July 11th 2025. We have sent held a joint call with 180 degrees capital's management team to revert to review terms preliminary Q2 2020-25 results which remain strong consistent with the Q1 performance of earlier this year despite the broader market volatility. The joint call also provided an opportunity to discuss a continued excitement around the proposed business combination and to provide folks with an update ahead of our special meetings of shareholders which are currently scheduled for August 22nd. As part of the process Mount Logan has engaged in several productive discussions with our shareholders. Overall we've seen a strong shareholder support and received positive encouraging feedback on the strategic rationale and long-term potential of the combined businesses. We anticipate this transaction closing shortly after the shareholder meetings are concluded. Following the combination the company will continue to operate under the Mount Logan banner and is expected to be listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker MLCI transitioning from its current listing on CDI Canada. On the asset management front Mount Logan's total assets vanished on behalf of the ability through the approximately 680 million dollars. This remains represents approximately 64 percent of ability's 1.06 billion dollars in total investment assets the long-term target of reaching 75 percent. Managing insurance assets continue to deteriorate growth from Mount Logan as we focus on scaling our fee-generating AUM through our investment management agreements. The growth and insurance AUM followed an investment by Mount Logan into ability at the end of the first quarter and reinforces the organic engine and flywheel effects that we've built at Mount Logan. Investments into ability enable it to ensure or reinsure new business which increases the assets managed by Mount Logan for the benefit of policy holders. On the insurance side ability entered into a new reinsurance contrast on May 15th adding an excess of 40 million dollars of my apologies for a co-insurance arrangement agreement with the ability to grow the amount we insured through the remainder of the year. We also remain active in evaluating additional partnership opportunities to support future growth as well as new insurance product launches. With respect to the financial results over the last 12 months Mount Logan delivered fee-related earnings or FRE of 8.4 million dollars representing 28 percent year over year increases. The FRE related earnings took 4.6 million dollars for the 12 trillion 12 months down to 11.6 million dollars in the prior year primarily due to actual revenue adjustments and tough performance in a sub-banished book of business to the insurance company. The 0.7 percent spread earnings margin for the trillion 12 month period was below our stated target of 1 percent. However we view this as transitory and remain confident in achieving at least 1 percent spread earnings on our insurance book. As a management and incentives to the quarter total 3.3 million dollars compared to 3.89 dollars that in the same period last year. The peer leader declined primarily to respect the impact of the wind down of evasions alternative income funds. And management fees are expected to continue to decline as AUM rolls up and we do not expect to receive incentives fees as it winds down. Partially offset into decline which continued growth in fees from the ability insurance and opportunistic crediting interval fund. On the retail front the opportunity to capture market share remains given the low industry wide allocation of private alternatives in a large total addressable market. While retail fundraising across private alternative strategy including private credit moderated in the second quarter amid broader market uncertainty remain committed to this distribution channel and give it to the key driver of long-term growth and go forward investment. The opportunity to credit interval funds or suffix are opportunistic and diversified credit interval fund delivered another quarter of slight growth of net assets increasing to 156 million dollars as a June 30th. Near to date through July 29th suffix achieved 6.4 percent in positive performance and demonstrated resiliency amid a period of market disruption. We believe the strong performance thus far in 2025 combined with its approximately 8.6 annulants given in the position suffix level for the fundraising momentum as a differentiated opportunistic private credit offering. Meanwhile I'll sit our other credit focus interval fund reported total net assets of approximately 200 and four million dollars at quarter end. On the institutional side our PDC and CLO funds collectively represented approximately 1.1 billion dollars in assets as of quarter end. These vehicles continue to provide good visibility into Mt. Logan's top line driven by stable P income generated from their permanent and semi-permanent capital basis. On July 15th we announced the successful closing of the business combination between Portman Ridge and Logan Ridge set the stage to rebrand the merge entity as BCP investment corporation. The newly combined scale BDC will trade into the ticker BCIC. We believe this transaction delivers meaningful benefits and includes earnings equation driven by increased scale. With over 600 million combined assets alongside enhanced operational efficiencies, greater capital accessibility and improved marketing. From economic standpoint Mt. Logan will receive increased distributions from CR crest investment management and its affiliates as CR crest will serve as the investment advisor to significantly larger PDC as a BDC investment clerk. On the CLO side the AUM for quarter end is approximately five hundred nine dollars. We continue to evaluate opportunity to scale our CLO platform following the successes realized managing CLOs which we took over through the garrison threat election. To download and manage the specialty finance focus vehicle the ovation alternative income fund saw its assets under management decline to approximately a hundred five million dollars in in the second quarter primarily due to the sale a large asset in the fund. The fund is in lying down in our priorities maximizing value for our fund investors. We remain confident from the long-term opportunity within special defense which we see this in telling segment within credit credit given its attractive yield profile structural projections ability to serve credit worthy yet underserved market segments that are underpants and non-correlation to the traditional sponsor back to work lending units. We continue to slowly to leverage our team's expertise to expand the CLO and derive long-term value for shareholders. On the insurance side second quarter investment assets for 1.06 billion dollars in a slightly year-over year during the second quarter Mount Logan assumed a new multi-year guaranteed annuity block of forty three nine dollars. That is total assets managed by Mount Logan worth hundred eighty nine dollars. Insurance business remains highly strategic Mount Logan and a key source of growth looking ahead to the powerful model effects of owning insurance and managing an increasingly larger portion of the assets in our house. Before I turn the call of duty to CLOs, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate our continued enthusiasm about Mount Logan's long-term outlook and the opportunities that lie ahead. We've built a business defined by sustained profitability across two core segments with clear visibility into near-term organic growth with the rest of management insurance segments. The acquisition and investment to ability remains the best example of how Mount Logan can drive growth organically. Since the acquireability Mount Logan should be able to forty nine dollars in capital to support MIGA reinsurance agreements and increase or manage AUM to six hundred eighty nine dollars. Today ability generates approximately six point four million dollars in annual gross run rate management fees and contributed four point six million dollars in spread related earnings over the last 12 months as a centerpiece of our forward-looking business strategy. While near-term focus remains on the announce mighty degree capital transaction remaining committed to driving growth across our business, achieving excellent results for investors and shareholders in our managed vehicles. With that, I will hand those calls over to Nikita to walk you through our financial results to the court. Thanks Ted. Good morning everyone. That will now summarize our key results for the second quarter of 2025. As for MIGA's reference and today's call will be US dollars. Mount Logan's functional and presentation currently. For our asset management segment in the second quarter of 2025, we generated four point five million dollars of revenue. Breaking down our asset management revenue further, our COO's generated approximately seven hundred fourteen thousand in management fees for the quarter. Ovation generated five hundred seventeen thousand in management fees from the topics our interval fund generated nine hundred and seventeen thousand in management and in senate fees. With regards to our VDCs, Logan rich generated roughly eight hundred thousand in management fees and we recognize the modest gain on our minority interest in Sierra Press which manages the Portland Ridge VDC. While these results contributed to revenues increasing by 42 percent quarter over quarter, the main driver of the increase in unrealized gains from our investment held in one way and another asset. The asset management segment results also are impacted by Altf, another is the fund for which the related net losses recorded within administration and servicing fees. Net losses on Altf were approximately seven hundred forty four thousand for the quarter driven by declining a U.M. and higher recurring non-reinversible expenses of the fund. We incurred approximately a hundred and fourteen million in operating expenses in the asset management segment in the second quarter. This includes four point nine million of corporate overhead expenses, of which two point three is attributable to transaction costs related to the term transaction. Excluding these corporate overhead costs, asset management operating expenses increased nineteen percent per quarter due to the higher economic loss over Altf and amortization expense on the ovation IMA as it mirrors the net asset value decline in the underlying fund. For the quarter end of June 30th, Mount Logan incurred one point nine million in interest in credit facility expenses which primarily relate to our corporate credit facility and debenture unit. The interest expense increased slightly quarter over quarter due to the paid in time interest on a debenture. He related earnings for eight point four million since the trailing twelve months ended June 30th, 2025 an increase of one point eight million compared to the trailing twelve months ended June 30th, 2024. FRE increased year over year due to the increase in fee revenue equity investment earnings from sharecrest and other income combined with decrease in general and admin expenses other expenses and decrease in tax. Fewer revenue primarily increased due to the increase AUM for ability, soft X, and first trust SMA as well as our growth in soft X's plea incentives net investment income. It drove the company's increased incentives. Equity investment earnings increased for the trailing twelve months ended June 30th, despite lower port in which fees earned as their lower expenses incurred as the year across investment managers. General and another expenses decreased due to the expiration of the transition services agreement and tax expenses decreased due to the overall net loss. The increase in SRE was partially offset by several increases in cost and savings costs from increased headcounts. Moving on to our insurance business, the insurance business generated $6.7 million in revenue. It's like decrease of 2.3 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a $3.5 million decrease in insurance service bills due to loss that is recorded on the newly assumed minor business which are treated as owner's contracts on day one by SRS and a $1.9 million decrease in net gains from investment activity due to higher treasury yields. The decreases were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in realized and underlies losses on embedded derivatives, attributed to our fund capital assets, and a $1.6 million increase in net investment income due to lower investment expenses on assets held by the company under the mod co- agreement with VISTA. The insurance business incurred total expenses of $13.2 million, a decrease of $10.1 million quarter over quarter. The decrease was mainly driven by higher treasury yields in the current quarter which resulted in insurance finance expenses being $1.1 million lower compared to prior quarter. This decrease was partially offset by higher net investment income of $2.6 million on assets held by the company under its modified co- insurance agreement with VISTA. There also was a $369,000 increase in general and admin expenses due to higher credit loss provisions on several of the asset investment assets. SRE or SRE's spread related earnings was $4.6 million for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2025 compared with $11.6 million for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $7 million. The SRE decreased year over year to do the higher cost of funds partially offset by lower operating expenses. Cost of funds increased due to an unfavorable impact in enforced update of $1.8 million related to the guardian block of our LTC business. Whereas for the trailing 12 months ended June 2024, there was a favorable enforcement impact of $4.8 million on the medical block of our LTC business. Additionally, higher interest accretion on our LTC liabilities further contributed to increase in cost of funds. Other operating expenses have decreased as a result of ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce expenses. Mount Logan reported a second deleted loss per share of $0.12 for the second quarter of 2025. This is compared to basic and deleted loss per share of $0.48 in the SRE month ended March 31, 2025. The increase in earnings per share resulted from a decrease in net insurance, financial expense, and increase in net investment income within the insurance second quarter of a quarter. As the June 30, 2025, Mount Logan's balance sheet respected total assets of $1.70 billion to the liabilities of $1.68 billion and shareholders equity of $0.45 million. The decrease in shareholders' equity from the first quarter was due to cumulative net losses and distributions of common shares. On the asset on the asset management side of the budget sheet, total assets decreased slightly by 1.5% quarter over quarter to $59.9 million. This is primarily driven by the decrease in intangible assets due to the liquidation of a large asset from the Ovation Fund. This is because the amortization method on the Ovation Investment Management Agreement mirrors the NAS runoff on the managed assets. To decrease an asset with partially offset by an increase in an asset, other assets have increased due to the first tax assets arising from the accounting and tax difference list. As I mentioned, total liabilities increased 4.8% to $102.6 million, driven by an increase in anticipation of the special dividend payment made in mid July to Logan Ridge shareholders. The quarter is net economic loss, attributable to the company's service agreement with CRC also increased the company's payable under the contract. On the insurance side of the balance sheet, total assets increased quarter over quarter by $26 million or 1.6% to $1.7 billion. The increase in assets was attributable to an increase in investment as the new line of business from the National Security Insurance Company or NSG was ceded to ability. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in reinsurance assets due to recovery from reinsurance. Our insurance segment reported total liabilities of $1.6 billion representing an increase of $23.5 million for March 31, 2025. The increase in liabilities was attributable to increases in insurance contract liabilities $30.9 million due to the assumption of the aforementioned new mind of business, partially offset by higher treasury yields leading to a lower present value of liabilities. The increase was partially offset by a $4.3 million dollar decrease in the investment contract liabilities as a result of increased mica surrenders as well as claims payments, partially offset by interest accretion on the mind of liabilities. Our interest rate swap derivative decreased by $1.4 million due to higher yields. Further, the funds withheld liability also decreased $1.1 million due to the recovery from strength and student rate. Overall, the company has experienced fairly consistent SRE and SRE over the last 12 months and we look forward to the transformational second pass of the year ahead for Mount Logan in anticipation of the time transaction. I will now turn the call back to catch for some closing remarks. Thanks, Nikita. In closing, we are very excited about the process of our business which reflects the durability of Mount Logan's fee and spread related business models. Our managed funds performance remains strong with low volatility underpinned by our focus on investing in high quality, private credit assets that exhibit strong risk-adjusted returns. We remain excited about the opportunity to play capital and increase our asset center management while we remain focused on enacting operational improvements to increase possibility across our business. We remain excited about the anticipated completion of our transformation, transformative business combination with 180 degree capital. We agree that the increased scale and expanded investor universe will slightly enhance our ability to drive growth in those fee and spread related earnings. A U.S. and aspect listening to the expected broader investment investor base and improve liquidity in our shares, which we hope unlocks valuation expansion and future capital formation. This concludes the prepare remarks. We'll now transition the call to Q&A session if the operator is pleased for me. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question today, please do so now by pressing start followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind or you feel like your question has already been answered, you can press start followed by two to withdraw yourself from the key. Our first question today comes from Natalie Lee with Cana Co-genuity. Please go ahead, Natalie. Natalie, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Hi there. I can hear me now. Hello? Yes? You can hear you. Hi. Oh, okay. So great. When we started thinking about the year, we kind of came up with an FRE and SRE of 11 million each, I think in the beginning of the year. Obviously, the first half has not kind of been on that run rate. But how do we get back to that? And if something structurally different now than what you had expected going into 2025. Thanks for the question. So I think, obviously, the way interest rates behave from a macro perspective does have an impact. We are sheltered a little bit by our $187 million hedge that we have that covers some of our investment portfolio. I say the other pieces that we've been looking at is our legacy mortgage book hasn't been performing as well as we would of like to perform. So that's contributing to a little bit of the drag disorder and some of the reserves that we put up against that book. We're also looking at sort of doing workout arrangements with these mortgages, which can take a little bit of time, which we should see happening in the second half of the year. In terms of getting back on track, I mean, as we said, sort of the insurance business is the flywheel to Mount Logan's performance. And so with the additional capital that will come with the turn merger closing, I think it's really looking at how we can put that and to express the use to generate return for investors. And so hopefully that will result in a meaningful direct increase to FRE and that perspective. Yeah, so there's a bunch of one-time things that happen to share. We just don't think our ongoing. And we do have a lot of cash insurance coming today that we do with that, and that will do a benefit. So between that and as you see that through just, you know, closing transaction and some organic things we're doing, we expect, you know, to kind of we expect that to really grow. Okay, that's helpful. And then I want to miss this one because I was on the call, but can you update us on the timing of the turn close and any more transaction costs expected for the SVA? Now, this is the first part of it. I mean, you know, obviously voting just open recently, and we feel very, very good about where we stand today. The actual data of the vote is August 22nd. And so that's kind of what we're pushing towards. So if we get the vote and then expect to close, you know, sometime at the end of the third or in the fourth quarter. Okay, that's a whole lot. On the cost side, I think the bulk of the cost was incurred, is getting the merger agreement signed, getting the proxy on file with the FCC, which was declared effective in early July. So any incremental costs now are really just sort of the natural closing process. So we don't expect sort of the run rate that we had over the past six months to continue. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Thank you. The next question comes from Chuck Burns with CIBC. Please go ahead. Good morning. I just had a short question on if you could again review briefly, maybe you've touched on it in terms of capital, but with the 180 degree capital merger almost done or almost at the finish line. Can you briefly go over the main benefits of this combination? Yeah, for sure. Great question. And we should have hit that a little harder. And number one is obviously, you know, it's going to increase the scale so that, you know, offsets some of the public company costs that we bear. We do think we'll trade a lot better and have a lot more liquidity from the most amount of assets. So the CDO Canada has been a fantastic partner for us over the last period of time. But broadening, broad liquidity and getting a bigger market cap, I think it's going to be very, very helpful for our evaluation. Obviously, you know, that transaction comes with some cash. And that cash is, you know, the financing has turned down a really good job at increasing that. So since we've announced the deal, they're an avatar. And we plan to use some of that cash to help drive some of our analytics opportunities that we're looking at. And again, the last thing I say is, you know, the management team of 180 degree capital brings the skill set that we don't have. And we actually think that it's very critical from a deal sourcing perspective. And that should help with fundraising capital markets and everything else, utility that goes along with this. So this is a very, very, this is a very, very good deal for our shareholders. And you were very focused on trying to get it done. Okay. Thanks very much. Thanks, John. Thank you. The next question comes from Masa Song with PD Securities. Please go ahead. Hi. Good for taking my question. I have two questions. First, this will be, you know, growing by the credit sector. And with many of those acquisition of COMVES earlier this week, which is quite interesting. Is there anything you can share on your current M&A pipeline? Yeah, good question, actually. So, yeah, that COMVES deal for those who don't know was acquired by manual life. And that business is a pretty good comp for what we're doing. And, you know, obviously if you look on any multiple on either cashflow or less publicly available in any way, yeah, it's obviously a very high multiple. So you've seen a wave of consolidation or space at very, very high multiples implying a lot of a lot higher stock price for now Logan. So that's number one. And then number two is, you know, our identity pipeline is probably the highest it's been in a very long time. So we're working on a bunch of M&A deals right now. And I think it all goes back to the same theme, which is scale matters. And I think a lot of people including that, you know, joining with a big platform like ourselves allows you to get the enhanced benefits of growth and scale. So we think we're one big consolidators and beneficiaries of this. But I think all these, your point of comments is a great one. I think it highlights the value on these platforms. Thank you. That's very good color. And then my phone has its own, you know, is there any potential macro has wings that this team is currently monitoring just given the ongoing economic uncertainty? Yeah, I mean, I would say, you know, the number one thing we don't expect to have, you know, our portfolio is in very, very good shape right now. But that is the, that's probably the biggest thing that we obviously focus on. And obviously, there's a lot of discussion on race. I mean, a lot of what's happening today is, it's actually inflationary versus deflationary. And so, you know, I, we don't really perceive massive rate cuts. So we should be, you know, okay from that perspective. You know, again, our investment strategy is in very safe assets. Like our insurance assets, which represent a big chunk of where you went, are largely investment-grade. And the rest of our portfolio is generally speaking as senior in the capital structure. So we feel like, we don't know what's going to happen the next 12, 18 months, but we feel like our business is relatively inflated from it. And the last thing I'd say is, you know, our revenue streams largely are relatively consistent. So we don't generate a lot of incentives. We don't generate a lot of market-based performances. And so again, our, our FRE should be relatively insulated from changes in, you know, from change to background. So that's reassuring to hear. Thank you again for the color. I will pass the line. Thank you. Please do so now for pressing start followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. At this time, we have no further questions, and so I'll turn the call back to the management team for any closing comments. Thank you, everyone, for your time today. As always, we're happy to make ourselves available for any questions you may have on the business. We look forward to speaking with you to recap Q3 2025 results in November. And I would hope you guys all have a great end of summer and a great weekend. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call. And you may now disconnect your lines.
