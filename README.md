Your support it is which drives and motivates us in striving to scale greater heights, so thank you very much. It's both a pleasure and a privilege to share insights as we navigated a dynamic economic landscape without losing an opportunity to seize opportunities for strategic growth. Financial year 2025 was marked by global uncertainties, muted external demand and moderating domestic growth, but your company remained resilient in its mission to stay ahead of the curve responding to a dynamic and often changing market landscape. Your company's focus has always been clear to create meaningful impact for our clients, stakeholders and broader financial ecosystem. The year has been a watershed year for the company. Our focus on four strategic pillars, group approach, technology, talent and branding continue. These pillars have shaped our business strategy and have been critical in traversing through the regulatory and macroeconomic challenges of our times. We have restructured carriage ratings business approach, bringing sharper focus to our sectoral strategies. We have adopted a verticalized industry focus approach, leading to a more efficient use of resources. This has led to a more targeted client engagement and increased operational agility, culminating in robust growth in new business acquisition. Our leadership in securitization is particularly noteworthy. We have achieved over 55% growth in rated volumes, which is a testament to our analytical rigor and ability to deliver value in complex segments. Say we introduced a new mandate in FY 2025 for rating agencies to monitor the use of equity issuance proceeds by corporates, in which space too we have made up for it. FY 25 also marked our entry into international markets. We launched carriage global IFSC limited during the year, which has made us the first Indian credit rating agency to step into the global scale ratings. This is a bold step towards disrupting the oligopoly in international credit ratings. The new company is slowly but steadily getting traction. In just the first year, carriage global has unveiled sovereign ratings for 39 countries and rated global bond issuances worth US$3 billion, laying the foundation for a more inclusive and competitive global ratings ecosystem. In parallel, our advisory and analytics verticals continued the upward trajectory. Carriage advisory expanded into new areas like alternative investments and industrial automation, while solidifying its strengths in core sectors like infrastructure and BFSI. Your company's work in easy advisory, impact studies and green finance underscores its role as a knowledge-driven institution committed to sustainable development. Carriage analytics was reimagined as a fintech entity delivering gen AI-powered solutions under a proprietary platform, EDGE EVIA AI. With good implementations across India neighboring regions and a growing presence in the Middle East in Africa, an analytics arm is redefining how institutions should manage risk and compliance. Internationally, carriage Nepal saw strong revenue growth and a healthy rise in profitability despite external challenges. Carriage Africa celebrated its 10th anniversary with a phenomenal increase in revenue and profitability driven by increased debt rating volumes and strong client engagement. These achievements have reflect our deep commitment to the financial ecosystems in more Mauritius and the broader African continent. The result of this multi-pronged approach with the focus on all verticals has been a stellar performance of carriage ratings which on a consolidated basis recorded a robust total income of 453 crows with a profit after tax of 140 crows. This is a significant improvement of 21% over the previous fiscal. A pact has also improved by 31% over the previous fiscal year. Technology has remained a critical enabler of a success. We have enhanced our machine learning models, implemented a robust disaster recovery plan and are in the advanced stages of building our next-generation trading platforms. Our brand visibility and outreach have also scaled new heights through thought leadership platforms like carriage conversations, carriage torture and carriage dialogues along with robust calendar of webinars and sector focused forums. We have engaged with stakeholders and reinforced our leadership across industries. Brand image as they say is ultimately the customer's perception of a brand. I am happy to inform you that all these initiatives have reinforced our brand's image both in the government and private sector space. At the heart of all these milestones lies the incredible team at carriage. Over the past year we have invested substantially in talent acquisition, leadership development and employee engagement. Initiatives such as the internal mobility programs focused learning modules and employee recognition demonstrate our dedication to nurturing a future-ready workforce. In conclusion we have indeed lived to the theme of this year's annual report Momentum with purpose. As we look forward to FY26 and beyond our vision remains bold and clear to be a trusted knowledge partner, a pioneer in risk intelligence and a catalyst for sustainable development. With our strategy aligning with national initiative like Vitzid Bharat and India's net zero goals we are poised to significantly impact the country's economic and environmental transformation. Let me end on a personal note. Mayhul Pandya our MD and group CEO completed 25 years of stellar service to the company. A comment and congratulate him on the leadership he has displayed. Two of my colleagues, Madam Sonal Desai, Dr. Mati Sekhiran and I complete a tenure and will cease to be independent directors after this AGM. Please join me in appreciating their outstanding contribution to the functioning of the board and in providing the highest standards of governance. I took over a statement in May 2011. The share price of the company was in the region of rupees 512 with the market cap of rupees 1511 crore. Today our share price is in the region of rupees 1800 with the market cap of rupees 5400 crores. This has been an incredible journey and one which has been possible because of the colleagues in the board and the wonderful management and personnel who have striven to ensure the company goes from strength to strength without losing sight of our core values. Commitment, pursuit of intelligence, fairness and integrity. I congratulate them and I'm thankful for their unflinching active support as much as your active support dear shareholders. I welcome to vastly experienced professionals Mr. Raji Bansal and Ms. Indrani Banerjee to be joining the board and subject to eradification. The company is poised for greater laurels and I'm sure the board and the management will continue to ensure the highest levels of professionalism with a focus on strategic growth. Let me retreat how much we value and look forward to your continued partnership in our journey towards excellence led growth. My best wishes to each of you. Now I request Mr. Manoj Kumar, company secretary of the company to inform you of certain other points regarding participation in the e-voting process in this meeting.

The e-voting facility will remain open for 15 minutes after the meeting to enable motors to cast their vote. We now open the floor for any questions from the shareholders present in this meeting. I would request Mr. Mrital Mishra the host to call the names of those shareholders one by one who have registered themselves to speak or ask questions. Over to you Mrital. Thank you Chairman sir. Dear shareholders, good afternoon. To conclude the meeting in good time I'd request e-speaker to be brief. Limit this speech to three minutes and to avoid reputation please. Once all the speaker shareholders have asked the questions one by one after I call out the names the same will be answered. The first in the line is Mr. Arun Kumar Vupana. Yes Mr. Vupana. We can unmute and please pose your query. Hello. Yes sir please go ahead. There's a power cut here suddenly. Sorry. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks to Manoj and team. Manoj I welcome you. This is your maiden AGM and this is also my maiden agent for care. I hope it will be a grand success. As I've known you for the past 20-25 years, very efficient, very humble boy you are. I wish you all the best and I wish farewell to Mr. Najib Shah, Sonal Desai Madam and Mahashay Karan for the extraordinary contribution to the company. Grateful care ratings scale new height during the last six years and compliments to the MD Mayhol Pandya for the record performance this year being bold, purposeful and transformative. Two-third 25 years as redefined from a rating agency to a comprehensive intelligent partner for India and the world which I'm very proud of and from historic entry to the global trading via Gif City this is a story of scale with credibility which expands globally from Gif City. I do visit Gif City and work and I'm very happy with your presence there and from it is becoming an ethical brain of India's capital markets too which I'm very happy. My questions are will care age remain primarily a rating agency or evolve into multi-line platform offering sovereign risk fintech advisory. What are we doing to nurture next-gen talent at intersection of air, risk and ethics? Any plans to raise external capital or spin of verticals like H, Avira or Care Age advisory into focused profit centers? Can we truly be India's answer to informed ethical future focused capital markets? Can air age be a green finance partner to corporate decarbonization and sustainability? What attractions are we seeing in this space? With ASG ratings how is care age developing into context sectoral benchmarks? How are we balancing automation with analyst accountability? What governance safeguards are in place for ethical AI use? Age Avira AI marks a bold foray into AI power risk intelligence? What will be our sustainable competitive edge in a crowded fintech space? How do we enhance synergy across ratings, analytics and advisory? Sir with the Trump tariffs they're going to rise fast and high markets will remain very cautious, investors too are wary with global retaliations and disruptions. What are your comments on this? And as the world drowns in data it is firms like Air Age that offer what we truly need, trust, transparency and clarity. That is our age I believe. In closing let me sell you the leadership for conviction and clarity. I wish care all the best and hope to see you next week. Kamanosh, I wish you all the best once again. Thank you very much. I kept my promise what in your meeting. Thank you very much. Thank you sir. The second in the line is Mr Manush Kumar Gupta. Hello. Hello. Yes Mr. Mr. He is aware. Good afternoon, respected chairman board of directors fellow shareholders. My name is Manush Mahagutta. I've joined this meeting from my resident city of Joy Kolkata. I feel proud to be a thanks to the company secretary and his entire team to help us to join this meeting through VC. First of all let me give farewell to our chairman. Just now he mentioned that he's going to step down after completion of his tenure and I wish to God for his healthy and prosperity safe long life in his to get his more achievement in coming time and we investors thanks to him to turn down the company and to help the company to come on this stage. I believe that your successor will follow your legacy to take the company on new heights in future also and our MD will also help the company to get further success and take the company on new heights in coming time. So thanks to the company secretary's entire team to help us to join this meeting through VC. The company secretary is very cooperative, very supportive and such type of people should be there in the corporate houses and we know him very well from long time. So what's your future plan? How you will reward to the investors? Sir, as per your balance sheet, your balance sheet is strong, profit is strong, payout is strong but no reflection in the stock market. Our price is very low compared to balance sheet because our price should be near about 5000 and market caps should be near about 10,000 crore rupees. But to see your balance sheet, I've gone through your balance sheet that everything is right but no reflection in the stock market when such reflection will be there. When our share price will go near about 5000 because in last one year our share price has not crossed 2000 rupees. In the 52 week high and low, low is 9921 and highest is 1964. So how this thing? And sir, have you any plan to split the share either 5 is to 1 or 10 is to 1 to increase the liquidity and market capitalization? If the liquidity will increase and market cap will increase, then price will go up and market capitalization will go up and small investors will attract to buy the share. So think about that will be a good reward to the small investors to split the shares in the ratio of 5 is to 1 or 10 is to 1. And just now you have mentioned that you have opened a global sales degree. So I wish to go on that said global unit should success because now the time has come that every Indian Indian or multinational company want their rating to explore some more things in the market after see because now the new investors want to invest their money in any company to see their rating so that such type of business should explore in coming time and try to reduce the expenses are because expenses some heads of the expenses are going on. So tick and sir before send the fire due to the investor education protection fund send a notice to them that they can collect their now the law has changed after 2013 entire holdings should be will be transferred to the government, investor education protection fund after seven years. So before that I believe that your company secretary is very experienced and very capable he will help the share holder. With this I strongly support and I wish to got for your healthy and prosperous safe long life but it's a law law does not allow to continue but board can consider after one year to call back again you in the board sir. With this thank you thank you mr. Gupta in next meeting the line is mr. Angkur Chanda yes mr. Chanda it can be his go ahead. Hi Madhavant. Yes please.

Next I call upon Mr. Vinod Agarwal. Hello, yes sir, we can hear you. Yes, respect Chairman, Mr. Najib Shah, MD and CEO, Mjul Panya, CFO Ginesh Nisha and CS Manoj Kumar Cv. Good evening and regards to everyone sir. I want to hear your annual reports sir. The consolidated operating profit was 4.2 crores, up by 21% from 32 crores of PAD. The consolidated PAD is 140 crores and the margin is 31% very high margin for a PAD companies do not have 31% kind of PAD margin, most companies have 3%, 5% those are manufacturing companies, but other than the knowledge based employee based company which we have good margin sir, the PAD margin 31% is very high. The only question which comes to my mind is stand alone profit is at 148 crores and the consolidated profit is at 140 crores. So, that means our subsidiaries have made losses with the loss making subsidiaries. The one would be the initially that is in the teething stage is 4.5 crores of loss in the care in global IFC city that I think something is a teething problem, it is in the first year of operation. So, it will turn around in sooner or later time, but the losses which are there still, they have been reduced substantially sir, in the care analytics and advisory business it was 23 crores, last year it has come down to 6.3, 5 crores this year, there is a very good performance, but still the losses are there, it brings down consolidated losses and even on the care rating, ESG rating, the losses last year were about 13 crores and they say at about 4.1 crores and this current have to be looked into and it turned around 7 and my other query was 1 second sir and 1 minute to go, and sir we got about 764 crores of liquidity. So, what are we likely to do with the 736 crores of bank investments, mutual funds and everything sir. Are we likely to acquire certain companies because we do not need cash to put up factories or this thing and other things sir, it is liquidity which is with us, how do we look into this, how I like to utilize this 736 crores which is lying as it brings, if you do not utilize this money and keep it in bank, bank will give us a lesser amount of return than the business if you do with it sir. This is my only thing sir, I basically come to the all the best, I sign off and I also say that sir there are other companies like MRF, they are quoting at 1, 50,000 so do not give bonuses or split the share, let a company also become like a Berkshire, a Hathaway or something or an MRF in India sir, where the share is valued more sir than the price of gold sir, if you dilute it then it becomes very dilute sir, do not give bonuses or split it of the share, this is my opinion sir, the others may have their own opinion, the board may also have it. I am speaking I am finishing sir, this is my opinion which I am giving to the management sir, signing off, we know that I am from whom I thank you sir for giving me time to speak. Thank you very much. The next in the line I call upon is Mr. Prashini Shannoy, hello, hello. Good.

Though there is a little power shortage here, but still we are able to do 30 second annual digital productivity. I would like to have a small idea maybe by a pamphlet. This care is something to do rating exactly only for the corporates or is there anything more than the corporate which you are doing and how do we charge the companies based on their performance size and other thing and we charge it on what basis. And some of my shareholders who have spoken Mr. Manojt and some who are between giant order and first order they don't sign. They can become none. Do I give a book? Is money is hard and money. Usually tax paid to the government. Nothing. Can be done. That's for the share value. Not for the dividend which has been blocked. You block it with the same point and this time. It is so much complicated. The more the value, the more the problems are there. The more the problems. Yes. I think there is a network problem. We can't hear you. I will just let you come out to that. I will come out to the open one minute sir. Yes, hold on sir. Is it clear now? Yeah, please go ahead. Okay. Then IPF should be simplified with either visually checking the unionness of the people. Like good old days when I had a share transfer only with high value. They sent car V like people to my place and checked up with I'm general owner of the transfer of the shares. Maybe 20 years back. Okay. That is the way they did. And this time car V is giving from their company special. I'm sorry. You have one minute to go. Yeah. Car V has set up a toll free number for senior citizens like us so that we can contact them easily. But in New York this thing car V is involved but they are not given in your inland curve which has come to senior citizens for some reason. It is better to send at least take this one agenda or notice of the meeting which had to be four pages to ten pages only. So that we come to know two three things. Name of the directors their type of activity are not only that the company's resolutions also. Today I'm not received till date. The AGM book not to blame but so I don't even know on screen I could see who are the directors their faces and all. And this thing is to have a hybrid meeting and if possible it can be IV of you can recommend the government to be little more accommodative to the real genuine owners. Okay sir. And my back is possible. Yeah the time is after I'm logging off these. Okay. So the next thing the line I call upon Mr. Vinay. Vinay. Yes Mr. Vinay. Hello. Can you hear me please? Yes please. Yeah. Thank you so much. Respected chairman. Characters present on today's board meeting company executives and fellow shareholders has already announced my name is Vinay. And I'm a long standing shareholder and I'm speaking from Mumbai. I you know thank you know the company and the executives for the exam performance that we have showed in the completed year. The dividends that has been distributed in the interest of the shareholders and all the details you know have been neatly documented in our annual report. And you know looking at you know the diversification of our companies you know business line. Both you know locally as well as you know in the adjacent geographies. I think you know pretty little you know room is left for any questions. I can only say that you know I'm supporting all the resolutions and I wish you know that the directors and team at you know care ratings all the best. And we look forward to more eventful years. Thank you so much. Thank you for giving opportunity speaker. Thank you Mr. Biday. With this week that's all from my side. What do you say Mr. Chairman sir? Thank you very much dear shareholders for all your questions. I shall try to answer as many as I can. And what were questions remain unanswered by me. The replies will be communicated by my colleagues Mr. Manoj and Mr. Maham. Mr. Arun Kumar has raised multiple questions. He has asked questions about the ESG rating, about accountability, about ethical conduct of business. He also wanted comments on Trump's tariff which is a question asked across a few other shareholders too. And about trust transparency and clarity. The vision and mission of this company has been as I mentioned in my speech to have commitment and pursuit of excellence. By ensuring we also are fair and follow the highest levels of integrity. I would reinforce and retreat this particular ethos which the company will adhere to and has been adhering. Given our mission to provide the best in-class tools and analyze and insights. Enable customers to make informed decisions. This is critical. And we are committed. I read it. Let there be no issue. No doubt in the minds of anybody. We have a vision of being a global research company and we can't do that. If we don't have these basic ethical values and ethos. So there is a lot of emphasis across verticals on this aspect. And our HR team has been working closely with all the employees to ensure that there are behavioral training programs. Which include communication skills which include programs to what we call unleash the leader in you. And also make them into future leaders. We have interactive sessions with the employees. All of which is based on the foundation of integrity. We also have rewards and recognition. For instance, I mentioned about Mr. Mabel part of having completed 25 years earlier today. We recognized and commented him for his long years of steady service and loyalty to the organization. So, we just assured that this should not be any matter of concern for you. You have also asked about the ESD rating and how we are performing in that space. The focus has been on ensuring that we adhere to the highest principles of what is required by each of these companies which have to adopt ESD. We are competing with multiple other companies including the big four. We have managed to position ourselves as players who can be trusted to give suitable advice on these areas. And obviously, there is a lot of back and forth which goes with the companies which seek an ESD rating. And I think we have been good trustworthy advisors in this regard. Across shareholders, there was concerns about Mr. Trump's tariffs. They are definitely going to impact India. There is a lot of uncertainty in the trade front. We do not know what will be the final tariff which India will have to face. We have been told through various press conferences and the minister's pronouncements that something positive should happen. So we are hoping that we will not be subject to the 50% and 40% and 25% tariffs which has been unleashed by US or other countries. But that is a call which is beyond our guessing at this point of time. So I hope Mr. Arun Kumar's queries have been answered. Mr. Manoj Kumar Gupta speaking from the city of Joy, thank you very much for your good sentiments. A question about the future plans of this company have been asked. The rating business is a highly competitive business. It's a close business. It's a business where we have grown tremendously. But where ultimately the current proportion of rating non-rating revenue which stands at about 90-10, we will have to necessarily improve the non-rating business revenue contributions. So that ultimately aspirationally we should be looking at towards 15-20%, which is the long-term aspiration of the company. So I believe that that will happen given all the verticals, given all the strengths which each one of these verticals have shown in this last one year. A lot of the investors shareholders in their current discussions have also spoken about the need to split the share, files to one, tells to one, and that liquidity will increase. But then you had another interesting shareholder who felt differently and who instead wanted us to retain it, because then our values can go up as good as bold. So you have multiple opinions on this issue. All I can tell you is that the reason why we have not given you a difference more than what we had given earlier is only because last year when we gave the extra special dividend, it was 30 years of completion of the company. So yes, we are sitting on liquid funds, but we just assured we have a strategy in investment committee, which will closely be looking at options. We are extremely cognizant of the fact that this is your money which we are holding, we are trustees, and we would like to ensure that we use that money well. So we will be investing going forward subject to the approval of the recommendation of the strategy in investment committee and the new board, which I'm sure will happen. So there have been concerns also raised by multiple shareholders about the role of IPF. We have little to do with the IPF's functioning. It's under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. And you're aware beyond a certain point when we retain the shares which has to necessarily go to the IPF. But we just assured there's a suggestion that perhaps we should inform them before actually physically transferring to the IPF. I think that's a point well taken. I would request the company secretary to take it on board and to try and reach out to those investors whose share they're going to be transferred to IPF to be forewarned that this is happening because they have not come forth earlier. So this is something which we will try and do in the future. There have been concerns also about expenses which have been told by a few. The number of employees currently is 598. There have been an increase in the employees from the early strength of 563. Now, this has been required given the spread of our verticals and the spread of our jobs. The gift city is a new development where we have done well. And that's one reason why there have been an increase in the employees. The money spent on staff, welfare, staff training has also increased when compared to last year. All this has contributed to overall increase in the employee expenses. But believe me, this is money well spent because we are investing in our employees who are going to be partners in the growth of the company. So we just assured that this is money well spent and we are cognizant of the fact that we should not keep increasing the expenses of the company. Uncle Chantaji corporate government is going to give us the money. He also requested that shareholders could reward Karnataka. Shareholders could reward the performance of the company itself with a barometer. It would be a reward for a reward for a reward for a reward for a reward. So, we will continue to come here and thank you very much for your trust in the company. Mr. Anil Mehta has also spoken about the trade wars and how much FY25 growth can be expected. I would not like to look into any crystal ball and predict the growth except to say that look we are on the path to growth. And we should be growing as we have in the last financial year. As regards the trade war, I have already tried to answer that it's a very fluid state of affairs. All I can tell is the government of India seems to be fully engaged. Our minister has made multiple statements and there are some areas which are going to be non-negotiable like agriculture, which is all again well known as told by the minister. So one would not like to hazard any guest on regard to the trade wars. Mr. K. Jiwal, again speaking from the city of Joy, has wanted to know, share his kyonya of spirit career 10 is to one. And he has also given suggestions for CSR cometically suggestions, pina kapani impediment of cancer patients. And he has also sought a physical copy of the report. I'm sure Mr. Manoj will ensure that he get a physical copy of the report if you have not got it so far. We will ensure that he get it. As regards the suggestions for CSR, I'm sure the CSR cometi will kick that in board and try to ensure he will ensure that we meet these commitments also of drinking water and cancer patients treatment. The splitting of shares, the special dividend, I think our calls to the new board will definitely examine and see how it goes forward. There have been concerns about the performance of the subsidiaries. While everybody has appreciated the rating company having done well, some shareholders have mentioned about the performance of the subsidiaries. Please have a re-look at your AGM report. Every single subsidiary has done well this year. We had some burden. We are cutting down those losses. But we have done well here. Care ratings on an independent basis has done well. Care ratings Africa has done well. Care ratings Nepal has done well. The ESG rating company has done well. Capital has done extremely well, cut down all the losses. Even carriage global IFC has had revenues. And as I mentioned in my speech, they have done around $3 billion worth of ratings. So there is a lot of work which is going on. And the process of cutting down on the losses will happen in the next couple of years. We can assure you that all those will get wiped off in the very near future. Mr. Athanu Sahu has appreciated the webinars and the information which has been given. I will just give you some numbers which will sort of enlighten you as just to how much we have done. A total of 6,828 media coverage has taken place in the course of this year, which is phenomenal. We have published three reports. We have had 28 webinars, an increase over last year. We have had knowledge sharing and speaker forums which have 127 in number. We have had opinion pieces published in media. We have had TV interviews where all our colleagues have participated. So we have had a lot of media coverage which has contributed immensely to the brand of care age. So we have done well on that front. Future plans is to ensure that we continue to be stable. We continue to focus on growth. We continue to ensure our subsidiaries do extremely well. We are hopeful that Gif City will start being very well. Care Africa, which is the malicious based company, has done extremely well and has promises to do much, much better. Both the ESD and the capital vertical have done also very, very well. So please be assured that there is no threat in the near future which we perceive. A question by Mr. Gautam Nandi was about, again, splitting of shares. I think I have addressed that issue. He has wanted the speaker shareholders to benefit. I am sure the board will consider that whenever it is appropriate. He has asked about the role of AI and what are we doing about ensuring safety on the AI front. As I mentioned in my speech earlier, we are hoping that enhanced machine learning models, which will be used for extracting financial and operational data from the corporate filings, will improve our accuracy, will ensure the analyst is able to predict properly. Now there is a continued focus on development of the next generation rating platforms, which will use these AI and ML capabilities. So there is a lot of effort on this, and yes, AI comes with its challenges. The technical and technology team is fully cognizant of that, as is our board, which has the benefit of a technology expert in Mr. Mano Chuk. So we are, I think, on good ground there. Madam Vasudinda, Vasudha Dakwai has also asked about the future plans. As I mentioned earlier, our focus is on ensuring that each one of our companies do well. And we are on the road. Thank you very much for your best wishes. Manji Singhji, employees, expenses increase one person's value. I mentioned about the increased number of employees. Expeleture is where they say increased volume, because it is a third category. You have mentioned Kiddo statutory auditors. One are secretarial auditors. The other are the other statutory auditors. That's why he saw two names there. You have asked about bonuses. You have asked about the fact that the company has done well from 1993 when it is set up till now. But you have agreed about the fact that we have not given any bonuses. That's a call the board will examine. I'm sure and will take in the next whenever it is appropriate. Mr. Vinodakarwal has also complimented us on the increase in the margins, which have done very well. He has appreciated the fact that as high as 31% fat has increased, which is phenomenal. He has highlighted that subsidies have made losses. But as I mentioned, every subsidiary has made money this year. They are reducing the losses which they have accumulated. And we will wipe out those losses very soon. He has appreciated gift city. But again, highlighted the fact that investments are made and there are some losses there. It's a new company. You will appreciate that. And even in the first year, we have done what all we did. Concerns have been raised about, again, the bonus shares and splitting of shares by Mr. And what plans they have to do with that money. As I mentioned earlier, in response to somebody else's query, we are sitting on your money and we will ensure that it is properly spent. There is a strategy and investment committee which will examine this and take the right calls. Mr. Shenoy has, while appreciating us and wishing us all a happy and wealthy. Madam Shenoy, my mistake about helping, wishing us all a happy and wealthy New Year. Best wishes to you also, Madam. Also talked of the future roadmap and whether the profit of the company will increase. Yes, of course, the profit of the company will increase. And we are hoping that it will increase under the leadership of Mr. Maywell Pandya and with the oversight of the new board, increase further. So that will happen. Mr. Kottwani has wanted to know about how we are taking care of our employees, what about the visit below a policy about the excess cash to be utilized, et cetera. Now, as I mentioned, we are extremely concerned about our employees. Our attrition rate, remember again this year, has been lesser than last year, which means we are doing something correct to ensure that the employees continue to be with us. We have ensured that there are learning opportunities, we have ensured that the leadership programs, we have ensured that the succession roots have been firmly established and they have huge employee connect sessions which take place where new journeys also are encouraged to talk. We have reward and recognition programs. We have employment engagement in the form of sports days across locations. There have been no complaints under the visit below. We do have a visit below a policy. So please, just assured that we will take on board any complaints. We do come. We have ensured that excess cash will be kept safe and will be used appropriately when the strategy and investment committee comes to meet. Mr. Prakash Galada has also again expressed concerns about IEPF about not having received the AGM physical copy. Again, I would request Manoj to kind of ensure that this copy is sent to him. And he wanted to know how do we charge business. I think that's a business call which we take and we ensure that we charge businesses appropriately without compromising on the integrity of the entire process. Mr. Vinay Ride has congratulated us and had no questions to ask. So thank you very much all members for your questions. In case there are some questions that have left unanswered, there will be answered by Mr. Manoj and Mr. Amiho. I would like to also inform the honorable shareholders that the board had a meeting earlier in the day where we had debated about the forward momentum of this company. And please join me in congratulating Mr. Vichandra Shaker who has been designated as chairman starting from tomorrow after I cease to be this evening. We have also done the composition of the various committees. Suitable stock exchanges announcements have also been made. So thank you very much once again to everybody. The results of the voting will be announced not dated in two working days of the conclusion of the AGM and will be integrated to the stock exchanges and also uploaded on the website on the company and NSGL. I express my sincere appreciation to each one of you for your continued faith, trust, encouragement and support. With your consent, I and all other board members would leave the meeting now and wish all shareholders and their families a safe, healthy future. Thank you so very much for your attention. Sir, you all can leave. Mr. Stop the recording and end the meeting. Thank you so much.
