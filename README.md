All right, good morning, and it's my pleasure to introduce Dan Fager, president and CEO of Anaptist Bio as our next speaker. Dan, welcome. It's the first time for me to host you at the Goldman Sachs Conference, so thank you for being here. Before we kick it off with the Q&A, I'm going to turn it to you for a quick opening remark. Perfect. Well, thanks for having me here today. It's my pleasure to be here. We have a lot going on at Anaptist. We just came off of a really exciting week with a six-month phase 2B data in our arthritis trial for our LEAP program, Rosnillumab. But a bigger picture than that. Our company is focused on developing antibodies that target overactive immune cells in autoimmune inflammatory disease. We have three clinical stage programs in development, two that were homegrown from our research engine, one that we licensed in. Our LEAD is Rosnillumab, like I just mentioned. It's PD-1, the pleater. It targets PD-1 positive immune cells. And like I said, in arthritis, they're over-activated. 80% of your T-cells are expressing PD-1 in the joints for RA. Really amazing data that we just presented. We'll get into that. We have a second trial that's ongoing as well for Rosnillumab in all sort of colitis. We will read out initial data before the end of this year. Enrollment's going really well. We're on track to have that. I'm completed soon. We have two other drugs, CD-122, antagonist, called AMB-033. We started the phase 1A last October. And we'll do an R&D event later this year to get through more details. And AMB-101, which is a BDC-A2 modulator. We had 383 million in cash coming out of the first quarter. We have access to a huge royalty stream from GSK. And it is a cell drug called Jumperly, which is a P-1 antagonist. It's selling quite well this year. There's a second drug, Cabola Mab. There's a combination that she is cage-running. A combination trial that reads out in the next few months in second-line lung cancer. So we're all capitalized. We've accessed royalties through clinical stage drugs. A lot happened in the company. It's exciting. Well, congratulations on your phase 2P data that you guys updated last week. And before we jump into the data, maybe tell us a little bit about the key priorities that the catalysts that investors should pay attention to. Moving forward from now on. Yeah, so we just announced the phase 2P results in arthritis. And it is in a 424 patient study. It's a big study. We have the second study in colitis, as referring to. It's 132 patient study that's been ongoing for a year and a half. The initial results, the top line results, will read out in the fourth quarter of this year. So that's the next big catalyst on Rosnall map. Between now and then, I referenced a royalty, read through milestone for us from GSK. I'll give you more detail on that. It's a second-line lung cancer trial that's going to read out of DoC versus DoC plus Jumperly versus DoC Jumperling and Cabola Mab. And Cabola Mab's a 10-3 antagonist. So either way, whether it's the doublet or the triplet, there will be royalty inbound. And what's exciting here, or the second-line lung cancer, is a chemo market. It's a graveyard. But what we do know is 20, 25% of patients are still responsive to PD-1s after they progress on katruta. A lot of patients go back to katruta. So this is a 750 patient phase 3 trial. Last patient was November of 2023, so it's been quite some time. So I think this is a big sleeper catalyst for us, ultra-high risk, but huge reward. So that's upcoming in the next couple months. So this is the next two catalysts for the story and the back half of this year. Okay, got it. So why don't we jump into the data, the phase 2, the rooms are otherwise data. Why should investors be excited about it? The arthritis is a market where there has not been a new mechanism of action approved since 2012, so quite some time. When we went into the development here two, three years ago, we heard from a lot of folks, lots of, let's say crowded market, it's a mature market. Well, we enrolled the trial quickly, huge trial. It's in the end, it's actually not that crowded. There's almost nothing in phase 3 development. You hear a lot about combinations in different autoimmune diseases as well in arthritis. There's been no combinations developed because they were all toxic and didn't give enough efficacy value over the amount of therapies themselves. So what we just delivered was, in about three months, 70% of patients who took Ross and Elma across doses achieved low disease activity, so controlled disease. We were stats say at three months on the regulatory endpoints, but the higher order response rates of low disease activity and then even clinical admissions were compelling quickly, and then they were durable through six months. And then we showed off-drug at least through eight weeks, off-drug, but in training towards three months plus, you have off-drug response. We have a once-month dose driving high disease activity right out of the gate that's stable, and then we have the potential for every Q8 week or better dosing in the long term. So it's a profile that together that if it can be repeated in phase three is best in disease. Yeah, you can show a lot of data there. I think the primary endpoint was at DAS-28 CRP. And then there's a lot of ACR 20, 50, 70, 70 CDI, and then a lot across many different time points. Looking just maybe like the totality of data, how do you think that compares to the state of care and which one of these endpoints or time points that you want to highlight, right? Your drug has to work fast, has to work deep, and has to be durable, right? So I hit on a couple of these points. The standard phaser regulatory endpoint versus a placebo control is ACR 20. And what that means is your 20 percent, you feel 20 percent better, symptomatically and clinically. It's a relatively low bar. We had over 80 percent of the patients hit ACR 20. That was stat-sig. What's true in arthritis is early, early biologics, TNFs, and these have been around for decades. And so back then, these were the low bar outcomes that were measured. And so there's decades of history on them for comparison. So you have to be fast enough for patients to feel better. But what clinicians and patients need is going out to six months in a year, the control of disease, remission of disease that's differentiated, but also stable. So this is also true for colitis. But a third to half of patients ultimately lose response in the plus or minus one year time line on biologics. And what we're trying to do here is drive those deep responses that are adorable. And so the reason we provided so much data is we're really hitting this from different standpoints is patients need to feel good, but then know they're going to have some very deep relief. And we're hitting on all angles. And how are you guys thinking about the phase three going forward? What which end point would you use time point? Yeah, it says lots of ways to think about phase three. Stepping back strategically for us, and I've talked about this colitis trial that's ongoing as well. We have, we're first in class program at this point, our competitors, which I think we'll probably talk about through this discussion, have fallen off for different reasons. Ultimately, they're not as potent. They're not hitting the target as hard. And we have very differentiated responses because we are potent and we are hitting the target hard. So I could dive into some of these things. But because we're in a first in class position and our mechanism of action here at PD-1 depletion is applicable to so many autoimmune diseases, there's choice for us how to move forward. And plus or minus six months, we're going to have a colitis readout. And so the reason I'm giving all those contexts is we have a couple paths forward that we're assessing right now that we want to understand better before we commit to what the next steps are. One is, should we put a partnership in place, whether that's around RA, you see you're both, we would look for one partner to do everything with us. That's a choice when you're first in class with a novel mechanism, in areas where there isn't a lot of novelty. The second choice here is we look at what we have in colitis and we decide should we move forward there on our own. And the growth dynamics in that market are very different than in RA, if you want to be a second line biologic player. They're more attractive in something like an ulcerative colitis, where you have branded drugs in the front line, like a sky rizzy. In RA, front line is generic biologics. And so the pathways are different. We have a choice in RA to move forward, but we want to get to the colitis trial readout first and then decide where we're going to play. It's not practical for a biotech company like us to go in two big therapeutic areas on our own. So now they answer your question. What would you do if you're in phase three for RA? Like I said earlier, you got to be fast. ACR20 is a regulatory endpoint versus placebo. You can only have placebo controls for three months in this disease. It's unethical to keep patients on placebo, beyond that given there's so much choice. But ultimately what you're also going to be looking for are these remission or low disease activity. You have different ways to think about short-term placebo control, but then also longer-term active comparator trials, where you might look at something like low disease activity to be differentiated. I see, got it. And then in the phase two P trial, you also had a mix of like biologic experience and also naive patients. Any differences in response across these two different population for your 400-mic dose? Yeah, thanks for bringing that up. So it was a 424-patient trial. About 40 percent of the patients were experienced on a prior advanced therapy. So that could have been TNF, JAX, IL-6, or NCIA, or Tuximab, or combination of all these things. We were allowing up to two modalities. So you could have had third line by class patients in as well. So 40 percent were second and third line. In all mechanisms, at least in RA, you see this in all these autoimmune diseases really, you do see a step down in efficacy between naive advanced therapy and experience advanced therapy. We did see some of that, but whether you look at our data for naive patients to advanced therapy, it looked jack-like or better numerically, or in experience patients, it looked jack-like or numerically better than specifically revoke on all active comparator trials, where there is a bias in their results where patients knew they're on drug. We'd looked as good or better, low disease activity in ACR 50 and ACR 70. So the whole composite here looks differentiated. But yeah, there is a slight lower bar once you move down therapy. And to get some perspective on this, for the advanced patients, half a million patients get treated into the advanced therapy is 20, 25 percent, are cycling through four more classes to salvage, which is retucks them out. That's a $2 billion market on its own. So there's a huge market in terms of the step down. And what happens here is patients need therapy. They do use remissions if they're lucky enough to get to them over the course of time. So huge market opportunity, huge number of patients that move through these lines of therapy, but yeah, the response rates are lower, which is what's so impressive with our data is they're relatively high response rates in those advanced treated patients. So now thinking about the Phase 3, will you also enroll a similar mix of biologic experience in patients with prior JAC patients? And is there a target in terms of the proportion of the patient who had biologic versus JAG or naive? Yeah, so a couple of different questions there. Just in our back to our Phase 2B trial, I mentioned we had a mix. About 30% of patients did have prior JAC experience, which I think in itself is impressive when you're comparing to JACs themselves, that you're treating patients that whether with a JAC or without a JAC, the data was pretty much the same when you slice and dice. And the trial was big enough where you can start to look at these populations separately, and the numbers are big enough where you have some meaning there in these sub-populations. For Phase 3, like I was alluding to, it really depends on are you looking to develop a drug that can be approved across all lines of therapy, regardless where it's contracted and the formula your position is? Or are you looking to design a Phase 3 program where it's more focused in the third or fourth line? So I think that's going to give you different answers on what endpoints you're looking at, at what time points and the way you're going to set up your program. So we ran one Phase 2B trial, but a program could be one, two, three, four different trials together, driving towards an approval on a label. I think those decisions still need to be made, what would be the right development strategy for Phase 3, and that could be different depending on who does it. So in a big pharma's hands, if we were to partner, you might look at something different or you might look at multiple options. If it was just us going forward in RA, you might look at something that's more specific to third and fourth line. So I think a big decision for us is going to be, yeah, you'll have your placebo control trial for three months and then there'll be some long-term extension, but do we have an active comparator trial in there? What's the right active comparator? So it's a little too early to speak to some of those specifics, but like I said earlier, strategically for us in the background, whether it's colitis, whether it's RA, it's the same drug substance, there's scale fast to happen, there's planning for the exact questions you're talking through, depending on whose hands this is, but do we partner the drug now, do we partner in a year, do we move forward in UC, do we move forward RA, all these options are on the table, what we've said is partnering is rational at some point, and if the UC data looks compelling, that could be the first place that we would look to go on our own. I see, and also the dose carrying forward to Phase 3, have you put some dots around that? I think you guys tested three doses, the mid and the high dose look relatively similar. Yeah, so how do you think about that? Yeah, that's a great feature. Just to walk through what the doses were, like you said, three active doses versus placebo, the low dose is 100 milligram monthly, the mid was 400 milligram monthly, and the high was 600 milligram every other week. Coming into this, we were hoping that the once a month looked like the ever other week, and that we would have a once a month profile, right, and so that's where we ended up. It's great that the mid and the high dose looked that way, so we could see her and say, right, for Phase 3 planning, we know we have a once month drug out of the gate, there's no loading. There is differentiation between that mid and low dose, that were the two monthly doses. In the population you were asked about earlier, the experience, biologic experience population, there was a distinct difference between the clinical efficacy endpoints, these high order response rates between low dose and mid dose, and then that gets backed up from translational data, which I haven't spoken to yet, but one of the two of the things that you can measure here that are easy are the PD1 high expressing T cells, what happens to them when you hit them in the periphery and in the synovia, so in the blood and at the site inflammation, the all doses did pretty good in the periphery. There was a small dose response there where you saw about 90 plus elimination of the PD1 high expressing T cells, but in the synovium where you have to draw antibody into tissue, the mid and the high dose had 90 plus percent elimination of PD1 high T cells, the low dose did not. They were not depleting out those specific cells were targeting that driving disease activity, so we have a differentiation on why we think we're seeing deeper clinical responses between the mid and high dose versus below in these harder to treat patients, and we think it's clear from the translational data, so between the two we do see a dose response there and that was important. And then the placebo at just ACR 20 at week 12 was slightly lower than wind week 12, I think it was 50 percent in your child versus like 34 percent in when folks face 2P in the biologic experience patients, how do you plan to minimize or mitigate any placebo effect in phase 3? So I'm glad you picked up on that because the phase 2B trials for a vote were long forgotten to some degree, and we were trying to stress how quick we were acting relative to invoke. You know, people think the jacks are very quick acting, they are, so was Rosnell map. And what you saw in our trial in ACR 20, again, the lower bar people feeling just better, you saw separation from placebo for us, star ant week 4 through 6 through 8, it grows, and then into 10 and 12, we had an absolute high number, but in that first one to two months, we looked the same or better than the jacks on a placebo-adjusted basis. At week 10 to 12, and this has to do, I think, with a lot of what you're seeing in all RA trials, you do see a higher placebo rate start to come up over time, but the curves are very different on how you got there. Jane Jay actually has put out a poster today on their PD-1 program, and they had higher placebo than us at week 12, and they were not that sick, just showing highlighting the differences between potency of our drug and their drug. But coming back to the percentage points on placebo-adjusted response in ACR 20 isn't what's going to drive commercial uptake. You need to know your drug works, we work fast, we look like the jack in an absolute basis, and again, placebo just for context, placebo is not placebo here. All patients are on background methetrexate in this trial, you are on an active product, so there is a different response. So the reason I'm walking through this is, we were stats to get all doses, we did show differentiation. You need to see that in a phase 3 trial. What I keep coming back to is, are you hitting low disease activity, much, much higher bar than an ACR 20? That's going to drive the commercial utility, and you're probably looking at additional endpoints than just ACR 20 in your phase 3 as well to drive the commercial label. Right, got it. And how should we think about safety? This is a new class of drugs, the PD-1 Depletor. What's sort of like the on target class effect of you, do you believe it has, and then for the drugs specifically? Anything you want to point out and how that you think could play out in a longer term? Yeah, for PD-1, which is receptor on active AT cells, the physiological role is immune homeostasis, it's immune control. All right, and so in these autoimmune diseases, you're out of balance. These T cells are overreactive, and in a healthy control, 15% of your T cells are PD-1 expressing are activated, and maybe 3 or 4% are PD-1 high expressing. In the synovial of an RA patient, 80% plus are PD-1 expressing. Now, a lot of them, the majority of them are PD-1 high activated. When you're depleting out, 90% are those PD-1 high expressing T cells. You're in effect, it's very, very targeted only those cells. You're bringing control back to a homeostatic state. So, all we're really dealing is bringing these patients to a, in the tissue environment, to what you would look like in a healthy control. So, it's on target. You end up having broad downstream effects. A lot of what's approved today is hitting various cytokine pathways and blocking them. Jax hit all of them and more. We're very, very targeted at what we're doing, and she says these downstream effects. So, the reason I walk through that, it's a novel class, but we know very well how this mechanism works, and that you're not going overboard in terms of depleting everything out. We aren't, you don't have any activated T cells. And what we're also not doing is we're not blocking the activation of T cells. So, the reason I just walk through that is, it's a drug called a Rancia, which is the only other immune cell modulator that's on the market. It's been out for 20 years, sold by Bristol Myers. And there is no link to any broad, serious infections to malignancies or anything with that, and they're blocking activation. All we're doing is targeting the activated cells, which is why we're acting faster than a drug like a Rancia. All right. So, what does this mean in terms of the actual data we've seen, the safety data we've seen? 424 patient trial. In the first three months, we were placebo controlled. We looked like placebo. There's no imbalance of infection. Again, everyone's on background. At the track state, half the patient hurts on steroids. So, you're already immunosuppressed. So, that's a big deal. No serious infections, no malignancies, no mace. And then when you look out over a six-month period on an adjusted basis, 100 patient years, you continue to see no imbalance to what you see in placebo. Another way to think about this is tolerability of the drug. Less than 2% of patients dropped out of this trial, due to AE. That's a very, very low number. So, in the commercial landscape, I mentioned a Rancia, the other immune cell modulator. It's the only one that does on a black box. Jax, Hemera, Ryle-6, retuximab, blowing out your B cells, driving infection. They all have black boxes. So, that's the landscape. It's not only are we confident with what we're seeing so far. I think on a relative basis, there's a huge headroom here compared to what's already commercially available. And so, when we talk about best-in-disease profile, it's the speed and efficacy, deep depth of efficacy in six months, but it's also the safety and tolerability that all combined are a profile of what we think this market needs. In late last year, I literally discontinued their PD-1 after the phase 2B due to, I think they said, overall benefit with profile. Any discontinuation, is there any negative we do or how are we guys looking at it before? I mean, it's really a positive breakthrough for us. And we just saw this with Jane Jay and their abstracts a couple weeks ago and the poster just posted overnight at UR over in Europe. Those drugs aren't as potent. So, Jane Jay's translational data they provided was limited. What they did show was PD-1 reductions in the periphery and they show a 60% reduction. We're showing greater than 90% reduction, full coverage of what we're trying to do. They're absolutely efficacy at three months on these high-order response rates like CDI, LDA, those of these activity. We were better than them. And then over time, they saw a loss of response. This is in their phase 2A study. They saw loss response. And that's what's going to happen when you're taking out some of the T cells, you get a benefit. But then you have the rest of those T cells proliferating and still driving activity. So, if your drug's not potent enough, you're not going to get a full response. And we're not surprised to see them lose efficacy over time. So, when you look out six months, which is truly what matters commercially here, their response rates were 37% LDA. When you look at six months for us, we're closer to 60%. And that's in a trial that was handicapped where there's a gating factor where we can even see max response for both of these trials. We were almost twice as powerful as them. Out six months, we were unable. So, we have a very, very different drug. So, when Lily says, we don't have the right benefit risk, well, it's pretty clearly not the right benefit over time to have a drug that would be competitive in a mature market. Johnson and Johnson, their safety profile looked benign, just like Lily's in phase 2a and ours to date. They showed, again, just hit this morning, it looks like you're approximating our graph that doesn't have numbers. Looks like 50 to 60% elimination of PD1 high T cells in the periphery. There's another poster that I'll drop tomorrow, but in the abstract, it showed about a 40 to 50% reduction in the synovium. We're at 90. So, these drugs just aren't potent enough they're not driving the same depth of response and durability of the response. And what's the overall aspiration for the drug? There's a lot of, you know, you can imagine, there's a lot of different classes, different TNFs, T cell modulators, IL-1, 6, CD20s and the JACS and so forth. What's, you know, when you look at your target product profile, what's that aspiration of what you guys are trying to achieve? Well, you just named a lot of drug classes that are proving a lot of areas. Here's what's true about autoimmune disease, systemic autoimmune disease. You're going to have exacerbated or overreactive PD1 high expressing T cells in that cycle, driving disease activity. So, there's a large number of places we could play. We took two initial proof of concept bets, one in arthritis, where we literally already had some early proof of concept there. We're running this trial on all sort of colitis. We're really excited about that as well. The lamin appropriate is the inflamed tissue in the gut. Similar to synovium, half the cells there are over expressed PD1 positive T cells, right? We know there's target in the tissue to go hit. But that's now rheumatology. We have IBD. There's other therapeutic areas that you can take this to. So, we announced with our Phase 2B update in arthritis last week was we're going to drive towards the UC data coming up. We're going to pick an area to move forward in Phase 3. If ulcer of colitis hits the TPP, that's probably going to be the choice. We do have an option RAs and alternative. And we did say we're going to be looking at additional indications in other diseases to start in Phase 2s. There's this drug, the composition matter here is out in the 2040s. We have lots of time to develop the drug in a number of different areas. And there's always a race once you get out to market where clock starts to tick. But we have the time right now to sit and explore other room diseases, other GI disease and potentially beyond that. And like I said earlier, we're never going to be a Japanese or European commercial player at an app this way. Ultimately, we're going to find support. So that's a question of timing and return on equity. And when you have a first-in-class now and best-in-class drug with years ahead of you before any other PD-1, the plea to move into clinical development, we could take advantage of that time or move as fast as we can. I think. So your UC data is coming in Q4? Yes. So why are you so excited about UC and why you select that indication to go after RA? And what if you tell them that you can penetrate the target tissue? Yeah. So similar rationale, how the mechanism of action aligns to the disease, pathology, disease biology here. I mentioned that the laminar periphery has a lot of PD-1, I express some T cells. We have correlations between the reduction of those cells in clinical remission. So drug-like and intivial in alpha-4, beta-7. What they're doing, what that drug does is it blocks that receptor, blocks, activated T cells from penetrating from periphery into the tissue. It's the same cells. We're depleting those cells. So there's correlation of the reduction of those PD-1 high T cells in the blood to clinical remissions in UC. It's similar to how other mechanisms work. We have animal model data translationally from our arthritis PD-1 high cells, which we saw in the gene expression panels, reductions of T cell activation pathway, B-cell activation pathway, as well as the production paths in TNF, IL-6 is what we showed. But the genes that code for IL-12, IL-12 RB, which codes for IL-12 as well as IL-23. So mechanism is known to work. So we're seeing translationally insights that also read through. Our trial is 132 patients. It's two active arms versus placebo. The highest dose in the colitis trial is higher than the high dose in the arthritis trial. And we know that at the mid-dose, 400 milligrams monthly, we are getting 100% or close to an elimination of PD-1 high cells in the synovium. So part of this is just making sure you're dosing high enough to get antibody. It's we already know we were 100% in the synovium. So when you scale for these things at a time, you adjust for the fact it's harder to get antibody into the gut tissue. So we feel comfortable that we'll have the antibody there. And we're excited about what we just saw in arthritis. Right. So we should have on target activity that's potent enough. I see got it. And again, you see it's also very crowded just like RA. There's the IL-23s and oral small molecules and so forth. What's the bar for success when you think about your internal go and no go decision? I think there's a lot happening in development right now in UC. Whereas in RA, there's not. But the markets, the commercial markets, you see is lagging behind right now in terms of the breadth of biologics that are available for patients. And the growth that you see in the next four or five, six years, it's going to be at least as big as the RA market in the second line beyond therapy, we think. So SkyRizzy is penetrating into front line as a branded drug over Hemera, over biogenetic TNFs, over Intivio. Right. So you're seeing a change there. And the outcome for patients is ultimate surgery, which you want to avoid and cost a lot of money. So you have great pricing, pricing corridors through lines of therapy given surgery is a high cost, last resort alternative that you don't have an RA. So the growth dynamics are favorable for new class of biologics. It's really the IL-23s, P-19s, you have the TL&As emerging and then what? There's actually not a lot new. You're seeing me betters of all those classes, you're seeing orals, which will be less efficacious, but different administration, you're seeing half life extension antibodies. But they're all different versions of the same thing. And you're seeing these mechanisms being combined. So it's actually lacking in novelty of different ways to treat patients. And you see, so we're really excited about that as an opportunity to play there into a market where you're going to have class switching, no different than you had in RA. And just for awareness, even the TL&As, they had great data three months. You had five to 10% points better on clinical response. When you get out to 52 weeks, and you look at remission, they look no different than everything else. They start slightly higher, they come right back down. One third and a half of patients on these biologic classes lose remission between six and 12 months. That's an issue. And so if we can have a drug that looks like what we just showed in RA, where patients feel better over three months, and our primary endpoint here is changing in MMS, score versus placebo three months. But if we can drive those deeper responses at six months, things like endoscopic remission that look like just other biologic classes, you don't have to be better in this market because of the class switching that we're moving into. And then you're at least as stable as these other drugs. It's a pretty low bar. That's already a profile within new class that's going to hunt. And then there's upside, so that at six months on remission, endoscopic remission, and if you could sustain those remissions over time. So we're excited based on what we saw in RA, if that translates further, you see in the same type of a profile, that'd be very different than the other classes that exist. I see it got it. Well, almost out of time, I just want to squeeze in one more question before I turn it to you for final remarks. So besides like looking at your early pipeline, your old 33 asset, so that space is heating up, right, that IL-15's CD-122 space is heating up. How do you think about that? And then how do you compare these programs and what should we care about and look forward to? Yeah, so thanks for asking. A&B-033 is a CD-122 antagonist. And that is a dimeric receptor that blocks IL-15 and IL-2 on various immune cells that are expressed in disease. CD-8 positive cytotoxic T cells, TEMRA cells, resident memory T cells, and case cells. So I agree with you. There's a lot of interesting activity with IL-15 antagonists. They're doing partial, right? They're only hitting IL-15. TEMRA has a program. The virus calypso has a program where they're in phase 2s in celiac disease, the LIGO, alopecia. We'll see where the virus plays, and I think they'll do it until they'll come out soon with the breath of their phase 2s that they're looking to move into. The CD-122, we think, is a more potent way to hit similar diseases. There's a couple out in the landscape. Footprint, affinity, all these things are going to matter. We're going to have an R&D event in the back half of the year to walk through this mechanism in a lot more detail. Relative to IL-15s, show data that we'll report the differentiation from other CD-122s that exist, as well as reveal our initial phase 1B indication, which we'll have already initiated by the time we end up having this event. So that's all to come. We're excited about it. We think there's a big opportunity. It's another one of these pipeline and product type opportunities. It's not just one phase B that I think we'll end up moving forward in. So a big opportunity there. The second story, it's great to have different ways to invest in the company. Yeah, very much looking forward to all these data coming out. And then thank you so much for coming, and it's a pleasure to host you at the Goldman Sachs Conference, and I'll turn it to you for a final remark. Perfect. Well, no, exciting days for us. We just showed some great data. We have other big reouts coming up. Like I said, we're well-financed at this point in time. And then we have an additional value stream in these royalties that are coming in that you can really think of the business a lot of different ways on value creation. So I really appreciate your time. Thanks for having me. Thank you.
