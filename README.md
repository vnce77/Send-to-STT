Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Orison Valuides-Asson Jehezidou's video conference to discuss the results for the second quarter of 2025. This video conference is being recorded and the replay can be accessed on the company's IR website at ri.org.com.pr. The presentation is also available for download at the result center on the company's IR website. We would like to inform that the participants attending the conference call will be in listen-only mode during the presentation. We will then open the Q&A session when further instructions will be provided. Before proceeding, we would like to clarify that any four-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Orison VR's management and current information available to the company. These statements may involve risks and uncertainties as they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. Investors, analysts and journalists must understand that events related to the macroeconomic environment, industry and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the respective four-looking statements. Present at this conference are Mr. Milton Pillow, CEO of Orison and Mr. Leonardo Santos, CFO and investor relations officer. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Pillow, who will start the presentation. You may proceed, sir. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for attending this earnings results call of Orison, Valoza Sanjeez Ito's for the second quarter of 2025. I'm here with Leonardo R.CFO and we are going to discuss the results. We divided the presentation into some points. First, we are going to talk about the highlights and then I turn the floor to Leonardo for him to talk about the operational and financial numbers and then I'll come back to talk about the perspectives talking about the highlights once again another quarter. By the way, I would like to thank our shareholders, our board members, employees for the consistent results that we have been showing every quarter, especially in the lines of organic growth in the final disposal of waste. This is a quarter with important net revenue margin by segment, EBITDA, everything above 20% year on year. A big consistency in the deliveries of, as I've already mentioned, as for waste disposal, as I mentioned every quarter, we have been consistent in increasing the average price, 9.8 in relation to the previous quarter, 4.2% above the IPCA. We maintain our growth journey in the average price that impacts directly on our main business, which is waste disposal, as I mentioned in the previous quarter, and we are going to continue showing this consistency in gaining margin in increasing prices. Also, in relation to carbon credit, there's an area that was created that would start bringing results related to carbon credit, and we have been showing consistency quarter-on-quarter with good news still limited, but very good news in the sales of carbon credit. Every quarter we have been increasing our revenue in terms of carbon credit. I'm going to give more details about Paulina project and we have been strengthening the capital structure. We have been having a broader reach in the investment and we had a follow-on months ago in a very complex market with high demand from investors, and we have now the better capital structure and this providers with the strength to face the new period of inorganic growth. We are going to show some photographs of the biomethane initiatives. In other words, we're almost getting there in order to start navigating all those numbers of biomethane. We had several positive highlights in the results, something that is always discussed is our SGN-A, but I would like to remind you that our SGN-A is provided support to a company, which is much bigger than we can see in the results. The SGN-A that you can see is the one that was used two years ago, building a biomethane job, a biomethane plant, investments of 1.3 million that has been invested for two years, and this is supported by a structure of engineering, supply, legal structures, which is already in our SGN-A, but it's not being reflected in results, because the results are going to be seen when the plants come into operation. So the plants will amount to almost the same size of the company it is now. So this is how we have to look at the SGN-A. Maybe we may have a perception that the SGN-A is still high when we look at the margin and revenue at present, as if we were just a company of waste disposal, and the SGN-A would be much lower if it were like this. So it's important to convey this message, because if we look at the result or the margins and all the revenues, we have to understand that all the divisions have been growing, but the SGN-A is not decreasing, and the SGN-A will decrease in relation to the revenue as soon as all those plants start operating along the next quarters. And talking about the business evolution, these are the photos related to bio-methane. We can see the plants on the right. And on the left, Zabotong does go out of the plant, which is almost 100% ready. There was an unofficial inspection that was held about 20 or 15 days ago, and we got the permit to operate, and they even complimented they said that it was one of the plants, the best plant they've ever seen. So it is already being operating in testing mode. And we've been doing the tests already, and in September, it will start using or injecting gas into the network. You can also see Paulina plant, you can see that the works are on track, and the operation is likely to be delivered by this year. So this was built on schedule according to the CAPEX. And speaking about the bio-methane sales, we'd like to remind you that the contracts that we showed the latest was neo-gas of 150,000 square meters a day. And it will have an adjustment according to the IPCC. So we are going to have guaranteed income for years to come. And there is a range of 560,000 square meters a day, and we'll have a total potential of 1.3 million that we are going to have along the journey. Half of the bio-methanes that we produce are already being sold in long-term agreements, and I'll provide more details about it. In addition, there has been an evolution in carbon sales. We would like to mention that the Paulina project at Wehr is ready to be completed. This is the largest carbon project of the company. And in addition to being the most important project, and by the way, it's very important to mention this because it's a project that has been registered with Vera. So it's a new line of registrations at Veja of at least one million tons of carbon per year. And this is also going to be applied retroactively. And we may reach 1.5 or more of carbon per year. And so it's a plateau generated five millions in revenues. And as for carbon, it's important to mention that or a strategy of go to the final client and having the commercial structure that will impact the asset in J, of course, but it's a structure that went abroad to sell our carbon credits along the months. And we can see the results now. Today, we have a backlog of imports, of millions of tons of carbon. And we have started to convert those quotes into sales. So our expectation is that now carbon will start having recurrent results on a quarterly basis. And every quarter, we are going to show in our results with more resources and sales for the company. I'll turn the call to Leo for him to talk about the operating aspects. Hello, everyone. On page eight, we bring the operating figures. The first one is the volume of waste and growth of 2% in comparison to the same period our last year. So we maintain a consistency in the performance of waste at the company. We still have a car park of a Parisi de de Goya near St. Aloisier, which are projects we are in the phase of maturity still in the ramp up process. And we still have a lot of revenue to be captured. We also have some projects and you're going to do knowledge with a great potential in that area. On the right, we can see the energy generation as we have a reclamation. The volume of energy generated has decreased a little because Chabotam plant is going to start operating along this second half. And below, we can see the comparisons of the previous year. And we can see that carbon credit is very much in line with a track history. And we consider all the volumes that the company is using on the next slide. We can see a specific focus on average price. As a ready mentioned, average price has been consistent in disposal above inflation, not only considering the mix. And we have made great improvements in the adjustments of contracts above the inflation. And for this quarter, 4.2% of actual growth. And we reached 83.3 rills per ton. I specifically now discussing the financial highlights. We would like to say that the reported net income is 23% above what we reported in the semi period of last year. Gross income and gross margin increasing by 5 percentage points in EBITDA. As we can see, to the right, 26% higher, 125 million, 26% above the compared period. On the next page, we can focus on CapEx. And that's page 12. This is the CapEx of the company, as Pilang has already mentioned, when he mentioned SG&A. We are very active in energy transition. And we invest in a bud with E-Project. We also have investments in the treatment of leachate and final waste. And also looking at the sanitary landfills. And there's a specific slide showing the relevant investment that we have been making, especially in the last quarters, when we started looking more strongly into the biomethane plants. On page 13, we look at the capital structure, the indebted level of the company. It's just natural because we make balances between investments, growth, and long allocated that profile. And we are going to be working on this a lot in the next half of the year. So we are to expect a company to leverage and prepare it for growth with a very allocated debt profile. The company has an average term of 1.8 times. So we are ready for this front of investment. And we are likely to see the results in the short term. I'll turn back to Pilang for him to talk about the perspectives. And then we are going to open the Q&A session. Very well, I think in terms of perspective, we made a list of five points. The first one is M&A, a new project, of course. I usually say to LEL that we have an important moment that we are experiencing at the company where the balance sheet is extremely healthy. And we have all the strength and we have a high volume of opportunities. And this is so positive because we understand that this is going to offer a qualified offer of return to shareholders. We have more opportunities at the table that we can complete. So we have choices to make. We have all the strength. We are prepared for that. That's the best scenario a company can ever have. So the company continues growing organically. So we do not need to look at M&As. And we have biomethane projects that will bring in even further growth. So we are in a very healthy moment. As I said previously in the second half of this year, we are likely to bring you good news, good news to the shareholders with high return. In addition to that, in the M&As, we will bring some new projects that did not involve M&As, but involved the process that the company had already started, that are likely to be disclosed in the future. So we have good news down the road in the organic and organic growth segment. In terms of average prices, people ask me about the actual growth curve. Has it come to an end? No, it hasn't. I think this curve is going to last up to the end of next year. So we have a good growth journey that's likely to happen when we look at the expiration date of our agreements and the efforts of the commercial area will increase the average prices. So you can expect gains in prices above the inflation for at least three or four quarters ahead of us until we reach to an average stable price in 2027. So we can see that biomethane plants are in the process of REMPOP ready to become operational. Paulina is according to the schedule and I think I missed something, something that we have already started, which is ITAPIV initiative. So in addition to that, we have already started ITAPIV and the main backlands and we have already started the new projects that we saw to NOGAS. So we have the construction front as well as biomethane carbon credits. I think I have explained well. The backlog is very robust. We have sold projects that has already brought in some revenues, as you can see in the quarter results, but we also have projects that are going to be used in the future that we will use biogas in its operation. And this was something that we did not mention, but I would like to focus your attention to that. We are having those projects that will generate revenues with biogas. And also we'd like to say that the financial profile is stronger in addition to the follow-on that has impacted the indebtedness. And we also have the allocation of the debt. The duration is above six years. So in addition to having a ratio net debt over EBITDA, which is very low, the debt profile is very allocated. This is what I wanted to share with you and we are now going to open the Q&A session. Thank you very much for your participation and now we can open the Q&A session. Thank you. We are now going to start the Q&A session for investors and analysts. If you wish to ask a question, please click on raise hand. If your question is answered, you can leave the queue by clicking on lower hand. Please inform your name and state your question. Our first question comes from Victor Kounia with Itao BBA. Your line is open, sir. Good morning, below, Leo. Thank you very much for the opportunity to. Quick questions on our side. We saw that energy transition has changed, has improved, energy generation had a drop. Could you provide more details on the driver and the details on the purchase? And my second question is in relation to many manageable costs that we see the difference again here against here. Can we consider this to be recurrent considering the asset base that we see today? Hi, Victor. This is Leo speaking in relation to energy transition. Even though there was a drop, we had some BBA agreements that had already been executed and we got prepared for this drop as a result of what happened in Joabuato. So we had already purchased energy and we are delivering the energy with even, we have been delivering to the project even with a reduction. So we had a good performance of biometane in Pauline that meets the PS1. So it's important to mention this. It's important to mention that some plants were purchased in 2024, even if the generated generated has come to a drop. But we got prepared to that. So we can see a positive result and Pauline has been performing well to meet the thermal power plant in relation to coasters. Yes, considering the asset base, we are likely to see this level of cost. We are looking for efficiency. We are also going after better performance in terms of leachate. We are going to gain a scale in projects that are still in the rent popular phase. So this is the structure, of course, that could assume considering the base of assets that we have. So you can incorporate all this into the overall platform. Oh, that's very clear. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andres on by with something there. Your line is open, sir. Good morning. I would like to ask the questions. First, I would like to hear from it if anything has been contracted for the third quarter and what to expect for the next quarter. And the second question is to understand the rationale of Pauline and Veja. Is there any rationale why you chose one over the other for each project or do you, how are you going to work with those assets in terms of Veja. In relation to price and rent, we are working on pricing. We cannot assume that anything has been contracted, but there are dates that are going to be used. So we are going to wait for the next call in order to disclose what's the news for this half of the year. We have everything to believe that the new quarters are going to be winning quarters. So all perspectives should be positive. In relation to Veja, I think we observe that the requirements are very similar, but they're not identical when we compare those. And when some requirements can be applicable to both players, we try to understand what is going to be better accepted by the market when we are going to do the trading. And as to Pauline, we understood that Veja was the most appropriate choice. So we do not have any history, track history to have been using two standards. And we did not have any problems in any of the projects. And this is a strategy we've been following. Okay, thank you. Yes, of course. Just a question, click on raise hand. Use the Q&A if you want to send a written question. Wait a while, we collect the questions. And our next question comes in written by Thiago Lima. Please, in the long run, with the consolidation of this expansion phase and new agreements being incorporated into the results, do you think the company will become a benchmark in distribution of dividends at B3? Thiago, it's low here. Thank you very much for the question. I think that the sector in Brazil and abroad is a good sector for paying dividends. And when you look at the profile of the business, you look at the consistency, the recurrence, the nature of the business, the results, consistency. Yeah, it's a cash call business really. I believe so. But we have to look at the company as a clear case of growth. So we have lots of options to invest in our assets. There is a lot of opportunities to cancel a data sector. So we should use our value sheet and our cash generation to capture the opportunities out there. But in the long term, yes, it's a company which has the profile to be a good dividend payer. But this is something we are going to look down the road. We are looking at the opportunities in the short and medium terms. The next question comes from Andrea with the investment to put money, everyone, and congratulations on the solid and growing results. I have three questions. I think of M&A. Is there any negotiation with a company that in addition to the Echo Parks, they will also include the collection of waste? If so, how do you see the company going into the segment? The second question. In the beginning of the presentation, there was the mention of additional four million up into the EBITDA with the sale of buyer guests. Does the company have any estimate in terms of cash conversion in this business line? And looking at other companies, we can see that the compensation of officers is connected with the performance of the shares. How does the company see this connection? And what is the compensation of officers system working, program working? Andrea, this is Laos answering. I'm going to try to answer the three questions and belong can make compliments. In relation to M&As, we saw some opportunities and we converted into our business. We saw that there were companies operating in the collection, but then we segregated the activities and we focused on final destination. We looked at the profitability when it comes to collection, risk collection, but we are looking at contracts in places where there is no concession activities and we also look where we have low entry barriers. We usually choose to be better positioned in the final destination because of the entry barrier. And it's very common to see in the collection and the sweeping something which is less mechanized. And this is something that makes us out of this business. And being a benchmark, well, some companies have different activities, but we are focused on final destination and we have some recent acquisitions. But in general, we have carved out and this is how we have been looking at the M&As. Their second question is about the capital level generated and the $400 million that you mentioned. The cash conversion of energy activities is very high. So let's talk about the three projects. We have Jabotum, but we also have Sedani, which has a reduction in the income tax. So biometane operations is very profitable and the south side of the banks reflected this and captured this potential. Your last question was related to connection of the officer's compensation and the shares in the shareholders meeting that we had. There was an approval of 5% to be converted into stock options. The company is about to finish the plans and just like other companies at B3. In this new cycle as a public company, we have the officers aligned with the shares of Oregon. I would like to add two things. About the first top, I agree totally with what has been said. That doesn't mean that we are not monitoring the market. And we see what is happening and evolving in the market. What is the evolution you're talking about below? Okay, I'm talking about the evolution of collection contracts connected to landfills with revenues which are connected and directly paid to the energy or water bills. When you're doing the collection services in actual cases, when you're going to receive from the government and you start receiving by means of a voice generator, the collection services is very similar to water and sewage activities. We monitor this, we look at that, we study, but at present we don't see any opportunities but we are going to continue monitoring to be prepared should this reality changes in Brazil. In relation to how the collection services are paid, if we're talking about long-term agreements with direct payment by the city, by the one that generated the waste, we may look at this opportunity in a different way. Number two, the composition of officers, I think this is a the company has a journey since 2013. So it was a turnaround company with a track history of resilience and also of contribution by the employee employees to come around this journey with going public and with a stand around story to get where we are now. Nine months ago we have to come to a stop to look at the five-year plan of the company and the team and what would be necessary for us to go on this five-year journey with BioMethane projects, M&A projects and also considering our position in the market. It's no news that this for this five-year project is a company that is going to growth in multiple times. It's not an organic growth. As soon as the BioMethane plans start operating and the M&A's start being reflected in the results. So you have to have a team which is prepared for the journey. So we have the company that says it is now and we see a company that we brought a board to do the analysis of our team. We closed our five-year plan 30 years ago. We had a gigantic event last week when the leaders were presenting the five-year plan that were built by those leaders and the board approved the possibility of 5% of dilution for the officers and now for the next 35 days 40 days we are going to close the program called LP and in addition to the compensation of the leaders of the company we are going to have a short-term incentive based on annual targets. So all the targets are cascaded down the structure and we always try to provide a bonus to our employees from the results. And now in 40 days we are going to bring in the targets for the five years connected to the LP plan that will bring talent to the company. We are going to retain the talents that are ready here and we are going to have a total alignment of our executives in relation to the big dream that we want to make true within five years. Our next question comes from Andrej Sampay with something there. Andrej, your microphone is open. Good morning everyone. I would like to take the opportunity and listen what you have to say about the opportunities that can come from the government of Sampal who we recently talked to Natalia and she talked about the project you're developing for Sampal. I would like to know what your expectations for the next auction for the second half of next year. I would like you to share with us what would be the structure of this auction and if that would be interesting for the company. I think Sampal has always is ahead of everyone else and this is a bit of what I've already mentioned. We monitor all those possibilities. In the case of Sampal we are really thinking about the government to provide, offer those services at the regional level. Of course offering a condition of differentiated, guaranteed pay, attach it to the water or to other bills and what we say we have to monitor because ours is very well positioned for the new opportunities considering that we are the owners of the land fields which are located in many of those regions. So we have to be positioned, we have to do the evaluation. Good opportunities may come up but now we have to look at the pacing, the timing of everything. If it's going to be according to the time expected by the government it's going to be aligned with the government project and how long all this is going to take. The important thing is to be prepared. I can say that Oregon is prepared and we are looking closely at the project that may bring in further gains that we are not even considering in our five-year plan. Sampal is also looking, which is very interesting to mention. So Sampal is looking at transforming the buses being powered by biomethane and we have been taking part in several forms with the government and they are likely to launch the new project in the short run where they are going and part of the biomethane produced in Polina may be used in those projects. So we have a lot of expectation. This is nice in addition to having the biomethane being directed to the industry. Our biomethane may become a benchmark in the most important city in Brazil. In energy transition for public transportation this will be a very nice idea and this is moving quite fast. Thank you for the answer. Our next question comes from Ali Shumdrisouza with Santander Asset. Your line is open. Sir, hello, good morning. Thank you for answering my question. I think you have considered the organic growth and inorganic growth and your M&A agenda but I would like to know what you expect or what would be the process for your decision making. So is there a minimum return on capital that you consider? Is there a specific objective in terms of size, M&A, strategic positioning? Sir, whatever you could share with us. Hi, Leshondia. This is Leo speaking. Thank you for the question. We try to be very cautious when we evaluate the project. Of course, we consider the return reflecting the capital cost, reflecting the reality of each asset. From the trick history, you can see that the assets have different sizes and they are also at different phases of maturity. In other words, we are focusing on this agenda and we are very open to look at different opportunities and we may not be very conventional at times. There are some assets that we needed to understand the reality before and we needed to make a loan previously. So we have all the financial discipline that every company has to have and we look at all the acquisitions in comparison to other opportunities for growth. So everything demands resources. You have to prioritize all those actions considering the opportunities and which one is more attractive, which one would offer better return and also the logistics site in this evaluation. Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Gabriel Francisco with the risk capital. It's a written question, three questions he asks. Could you provide details on the next step to trade by methane of Sargipi? And the second, could you provide more information about the trading of carbon credits in power of the pollina? And is there any update of the so-called purchase of by methane by Petrobras? Gabriel, this is level now. I'm going to start and now may compliment my answer. So we had intention protocol. We are very enthusiastic with the agenda. So that we are not connected to Sargaz until the everything is completed, executed. In the Sargipi, we have other potential clients, not only this one. Of course, we look at this client. We consider it as a good partner. We are developing a good relationship, but this is not the only option we have in relation to carbon credit in pollina. There is a high volume of perspective and stock carbon. I think it was clear when we communicated that with the market. So we are going to have a very important volume to be traded. Our area is very focused on the sales of the carbon. So it's a pipeline of potential transactions, and that involves pollina assets. It's important to mention that to have a project at Vaha and other good standards brings diversification of the portfolio, which is important. You may have a client looking at the requirements of the good standards or Vaha with a different angle. So it's very important to have projects registered in both environments, because we have more flexibility, we have bigger portfolio, we have more diversification, and we'll have more power to the sales area to meet all types of clients. So it's very important to have all this on our radar, but we start with a pollina now they not only have carbon to be sold and to be traded, but as I say, we can have products on the shelf. We have the products that have been audited, have already been registered, so the products are ready to be sold or traded on the spot. In this public call of Petrobras, we've been monitoring this as all the market. We have been interacting with the client, and we're very enthusiastic according to the client's timing. We're very enthusiastic about this front, but as I've always said, we have the support of the banks that cover for us, and as we have mentioned in the previous call, Petrobras is a potential client, of course, a very good client, but it's a potential client, one of many. So we have made some agreements with other clients as well. Our next question comes in writing by Gile Mihodrig with trigonocapital. His has. Could you make some, give some examples of operational synergies with new M&As and the landfills the company already? Of course, you have the standard synergy of using the same platform, but whenever you make an acquisition, for example, in the same region, you have the same permitting process, you're already familiar with that permitting process with the Environmental Agency, and also those which are adjacent, activities which are adjacent, you may have some synergies with the team. I think the expertise that we have when you explore by guests, you can replicate in the acquisitions, considering what you have already developed in the bio-methane process. So the synergies that are going to offer present value are the commercial ones, when we consider the expertise, when we made the development of the circular economy and bio-methane projects, and also when you know the project, the suppliers in terms of CapEx, it's much easier for you to replicate all this. And of course, you have a level of synergy with the administrative and financial area, but at a lower degree. The most value is to replicate what you have already done in the previous project in the new acquisitions. Next question is in writing by Mr. Sejdis Sozamel, investor, in relation to the joint venture with Terra on organic fertilizers. What's the initiative like now? Oh, the initiative is doing well. The joint vein with Terra is not really a pilot plant because it was thought of so that we could have a learning curve in the generation of fertilizers coming from sewage treatment's lodge. So we have been learning a lot with this initiative. So in every time you start a new business, for example, fertilizing fertilizers coming from the lodge, it's something new, not many people do that in Brazil. There's a lot of learnings to be captured, and we have been learning a lot. In the beginning, we nearly had to give our fertilizers for free to the farmers. So we had to break this barrier for them to understand that the fertilizers came from waste, and you have qualitative gains, cost gains when we execute the fertilizers because of the characteristic of the venture is already generating results. It's not relevant because it's not so big, but it generates results and returns, which is very good considering the investment made. And the point here is to have one more avenue for growth, which is already ready for the right moment. This is not our priority to grow on this avenue, because we do not have enough this structure to follow all those journeys. So now we are focusing on by methane and M&As. But in the long run, when those other divisions become mature, we are going to give more attention to transformation of this ledge that we receive from our archapart into fertilizers and give another step ahead together with the sewage judgment companies so that we can establish new partnerships for this purpose. The Q&A session has been completed. We would now like to thank Q&A and turn the floor to Mr. Pillow for his final remarks. Once again, I would like to thank for all the people who took part in this call, and thank you very much for the quality questions. And once again, I thank all our employees for having helped us to go on this very successful journey. Artisan conference call has been completed. We would like to thank you for your participation and have a nice day, everyone.
