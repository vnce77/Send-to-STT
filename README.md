Good morning everyone, a warm welcome to all of you to the hotel vidder here in Zurich and to those of you in the live stream. On behalf of BKW, I would like to welcome you to the presentation of the 2025 Half-Year Financial Results. My name is Marisa Fetser. I am the head of Group Topics in Corporate Communications at BKW. On stage with me, I would like to welcome Robert Eacher, the CEO of BKW and Martin Zwissig, CFO of BKW, also present on the slide behind me and on the cover of our Half-Year Report is Mr. Stefan Anen. Stefan Anen is the team leader of network construction at BKW in the Bernese Oberland region. Together with his team, he has, among other things, replaced power cables in the municipality of Laoen and thanks to his project Stefan Anen and his team have increased the security of supply in the region. On a daily basis, they contribute to a reliable power supply for our customers and together with over 12,000 other BKW employees, they are developing solutions for a comprehensive energy transition that includes energy production, marketing, energy storage, energy distribution and energy efficient infrastructure and buildings. Now, please allow me to briefly introduce today's conference program. Before I will hand over to BKW CEO Robert Eacher. First of all, Robert Eacher will start by briefly explaining the Half-Year Results and the milestones achieved in the first six months. After that, BKW's CFO Martin Zwissig will explain the financial results of the first half of 2025. In detail, finally, Robert Eacher will provide an outlook for the current 2025 financial year. As usual, there will be a questions and answers session after the presentations given by Robert Eacher and Martin Zwissig. Can you esteemed participants in the live stream or welcome to submit your questions either online during the conference or later on together with the questions from our guests here in the room during the Q&A. Let's now begin with the presentation of BKW's Half-Year Results 2025 Robert Eacher. You have the floor. Thank you very much. Marisa, I would like to welcome you to the presentation of BKW's Half-Year Results 2025. I would like to briefly go into the results. In the first six months, we have reached a good result within the line of our expectations. BKW, in this time, has reached a total operating income of 2.252 billion Swiss francs. That's a minus of about 3.4% per year on year. Then we have an E-bit of 311 million Swiss francs. It's a little bit lower than the previous year. This is due to the normalization in the energy markets that has continued, and we also had less hydropower available. This also influenced the E-bit than the reported net profit is also a little bit lower, but also in line as expected. We have had an impact due to the lower performance of the sthenfo of the nuclear power plant of Muleberg that had to be factored in, so the difference is a minus to 203 million Swiss francs. Now, let me go into a few activities. First of all, energy solutions segment. We have expanded our production and flexibility in the field of renewable energies. Here it is very gratifying to see that with various plants, we were able to make great progress for various facilities. First of all, we received the building permit for the Molesour Ground Mounted Facility in Santimier, and for this we had to abandon, however, the Alpine Chingle PV project. You might have seen that in our report. Now, for us, it's also very important that the wind farm in Chattanooga is very well proceeding. We're almost at half time when it comes to the construction work. As you have seen, we invested into this wind farm. It will generate about 300 megawatt per year. Then another highlight in June, in July, was the inauguration of the Oberhaasli power plant. Spittelum, the dam wall, was heightened and renovated. That was about time to do so. So we built a new wall that was now inaugurated. It's an extremely impressive facility and plant. If you ever go there, please have a look at it, it's really worth it. It's also very important to us to be very flexible and that we can proceed there. We have a project that we've started with a facility for the start of a large battery storage project at World Drop in Germany with 300 megawatt performance or capacity. With a very high capacity and here, we want to invest about 200 million Swiss francs. We assume that if everything goes well, that already next year, we will be able to start with the construction. This facility is very well placed because a coal power plant was originally planned. But we already have a lot of facilities on site. Now, the marketing of the flexible PV systems, such as power flex, for example, means that we can bundle certain systems, not only PV systems, but also others. So producers and consumers can be brought together and that can be controlled together in terms of PV systems and we can use those on the balancing energy markets. 370 megawatt has already been under contract. Now, for us, it is also very important to reach an agreement with the environmental associations when it comes to the ground-mounted facility, PV's facility at Belmos Solar. We were supported by our federal council or Albert Rushdie. This PV ground-mounted system will become a little bit slower, smaller, but I think we have better chances that it can be built in the near future. Then on to power grid, it is a very stable business segment, as usual. The focus here is on our customers. We had a backlog, which was also mentioned in the media when it comes to grid connections. We have now really worked on these grid connections, so everything is now done. All the applications have been granted and connected and we are well on track then. In terms of smart meters, we've also made great progress. It is now the case that we install over 500 of these smart meters per day. So in total, it's more than 80,000 smart meters that have been installed and we will continue to do so until 2028. We've also communicated that the minimum feed-in remuneration for solar power that is actually June next year, that we want to introduce this already this year. So the producers of small PV systems will receive six sound team per kilowatt-hour and I think BKW has shown by this that we took their issues and their requests seriously. Then on to the segment of infrastructure and buildings, all business areas, meaning engineering and for services and building solutions have increased their profitability and their revenues use. We were able to reduce the operating costs in the terms of engineering. We have completed our competencies and skills. We have acquired various smaller plants of very specialized companies with targeted expertise, for example, in project planning, project controlling, especially in Germany. We can see that large customers like to work together with local producers or local companies and that's why it is very important for us to be a kind of a one-stop shop. So that is a major advantage for us. When it comes to infrastructure services, we were able to work mainly in the high-voltage cable area in Germany. We were able to strengthen our position in Germany as a leading company and provider. The Austin-Custin Light Zone was 380 kilowatt, for example, was one, this center was one, and this is a major order and assignment for us. All the areas had a very solid revenue income, capacities were good and the markets still offers great possibilities and opportunities, even massive opportunities for the second half year. But there are some challenging situations as well. For example, the PV market in Switzerland has decreased quite a bit. It's not only us who feels this, but everyone can feel that so building solution will feel this impact as well. But we assume that this will recover as well once the uncertainty is coming with the Electricity Act have been handled. So this was it from my side. I would like to hand over to Martin Swiss for the details of the finances. Thank you, Robert, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would also like to welcome you to today's analyst and media conference. I'm very pleased to take you through the details of the half-year results for 2025. Now, first of all, the key figures in an overview. BKW generated total revenues of $2.25 billion in the first six months of 2025. And that corresponds to a decline of 3.4%. And I will come back to the details of this development later on when I talk about the individual business segments, EBIT, this decreased to 310.7 Swiss million francs, which corresponds to a decrease of 29.1%, while the infrastructure and buildings business segment was able to increase its earnings compared to the previous year, the EBIT result of power grid was slightly lower and that of energy solutions substantially lower. And that was expected. That profit declined by 43.9% to 203.3 million, thus dropping disproportionately compared to EBIT. The considerable slightest due among others to the subpar performance of the Muleberg Stenfo Fund, and I'm going to cover this in a later slide. The operating net profit that's Stenfo adjusted for the performance of the Stenfo, the operating performance of the group also declines by 30.4% to 210.4 million. Cash flow from operating activities is at 161.6 million, despite the lower operating result is only slightly below the previous year. The cash conversion rate is increased substantially over the prior year period, and details will be provided in the comments on the cash flow statement later on. And finally, equity ratio. The equity ratio was further strengthened to a very solid 50.9% thanks to profit retention. Now, this slide shows you how the segments have contributed to growth, both in terms of revenue and EBIT. And I've already mentioned that earlier on, in energy solutions, the revenue decline amounts to 66.6 million. The decrease in consolidated revenue is thus mainly attributable to the energy solutions segment. Power grid, the revenue of power grid also shrinks by 20.7 million francs. The reason for this is the fact that we pass on Swiss grid's tariff reduction for ancillary services and for the winter power reserve, which however are both EBIT neutral. Infrastructure and buildings, this segment increased this revenue by 9.1 million. The EBIT bridge on the right hand side clearly shows the expected negative impact of the energy solutions business segment compared with the previous year. At the EBIT level, earnings dropped by 133.3 million. Although prices were hedged at a higher level, they mostly cannot compensate for the lower management result from trading. In power grid, EBIT is lower than in the previous year's period due to the increase in costs in connection with the energy transition. Infrastructure and buildings was able to increase a bit by 6.4 million, that is 26%, and all three units have contributed to the improvements, so all three units of infrastructure and buildings. On this and the next three slides, I will take a deeper dive into the individual segments, energy solutions, power grid and infrastructure and buildings. First of all, energy solutions, that's on this slide. The revenue of energy solutions segment shrinks by 6.3% to 992 million Swiss francs. The decline was driven by a generally lower level of electricity prices on the energy markets and lower generation from hydro and wind power plants. The EBIT of energy solutions amounts to 207 million. In the first half of 2025, that is a bit more than 130 million Swiss francs less than last year. Although prices were hedged at a higher level, and that's a plus of 75 million for the first six months, but this positive effect is offset by lower volumes from hydro and wind power plants, as well as the weaker performance of the stenfo of the Leipstadt plant. The main driver behind the EBIT decline is the trade and management result. In 2024, 65% and that was a strong result, but that was all recorded the first half of the year, and 35% the normalization of the market materialized, and that's why only 35% were generated in the second half of the year, and that explains the rather large difference year-on-year. The increasing result was significantly lower than the first half of 2024. For the sake of completeness, I would like to mention that no significant impairments on property plant and equipment were recorded in the period. In the prior year, a write-up of 24 million Swiss francs on a new building in the hydro Swiss unit was recorded. Now, on the production mix, in the first half of the year, BKW produced five terroton hours of energy and thus 5.2% less in the previous year. While the first half of 2024 was extraordinarily wet, the first two quarters of 25 were much drier, so that hydro volumes declined by 0.5 terroton hours, and that is the blue bar that you can see here, the first blue bar. Due to unfavorable wind conditions in Italy and Germany, 0.5 terroton hours less wind energy were produced, and that is the green bar that you can see here on the right-hand side. These weather conditions resulted in increased use of thermal power plants in both countries albeit with hardly any effect on earnings. After the annual results media conference in March, we presented this slide to you. Here you can see the factors that had a favorable effect in 2024, and we have now amended the graphs to reflect the first half of 2025. Now, on the left, that's on the volatility of power prices. What you can see here are the remarkable fluctuations of the three year forward power prices in the corresponding year, while the dashed curve shows the development of average prices. Forward price volatility eased further into 2025 is expected, and this explains the lower trading result and portfolio management result. Now, in the middle you can see the hydro production. In 2024, high precipitation levels led to an increase in production from hydro power plants that was 0.5 terroton hours. In a multi-year comparison, production was 25% higher than normal. This effect did not recur in the first half year of 2025, and we are now at 2023 levels, more or less as expected. Now, on the right-hand side, you can see the Stenfo performance, and just to remind you, BKW's result is impacted by Stenfo's performance in two ways. The performance of our own Stenfo for the Muleberg plant impacts our financial result, while the Stenfo of Leipstadt plant, and you can see this here, in which BKW holds a stake of 14.5%, influences the result with respect to higher or lower energy procurement costs. So that has an impact on EBIT. In 2024, Stenfo's performance was extraordinary good. It was essentially above the target of 2.1%. In the first half year of 2025, the performance has now been negative for both Stenfo's. Despite rising stock markets, the funds didn't benefit because they mostly invest in U.S. dollar denoted shares. The appreciation of the Swiss franc because of currency effects led to negative returns in the local currency. Overall, if we take a look at these three drivers, the factors that positively influenced results in 2024 did not recur, and that was actually expected. Now on to the power grid. This segment two records a slight decline of 20.7 million or 6.1%. The lower revenue is mainly attributable to tariff reductions. I mentioned the fact that Swiss grid and that we pass on the prices for the ancillary services and the winter power reserve. EBIT of the grid business drops by 4.4% from 72.5 million to 69.3 million. The reason is higher operating costs. Costs increased year on year in particular due to increasing expenses associated with the energy transition. These are in the main costs arising in connection with the smart meter rollout. There are also strategic staff increases and also impairments had a profit reducing effect. They are the consequence of a slightly expanded regulatory asset base which has resulted from increased investing activities. Overall, the power grid segment has always been a very stable segment with year on year variances of just a few million. Now finally, infrastructure and buildings. First of all, revenue. Revenue rose by 1% to 957.5 million. Revenue declines organically in those single digit million range slightly and can be overcompensated by a slight growth from acquisitions in the amount of 13.7 million. Now EBIT, in this business segment the focus on improving operating performance remains more important than sales growth. EBIT improved further in line with this arising by 26% to 30.8 million. All three areas, units were able to outperform their previous year results. So operating costs were reduced by 10 million compared to the previous year. This underscores the positive trend and shows that actions taken in previous two years in the previous two years are bearing fruit. Overall, the infrastructure and building segment recorded an EBIT margin of 3.2% that is 0.6% points more than in the first half of 2024. This also makes it clear that we are not yet where we want to be as we explained at the capital market same. But it is another positive interim result. Let's now leave the income statement and move on to cash flows. Cash amounted to 631.9 million at the reporting date. That's the bar on the right hand side. That is a decrease of 240.3 million in the first half year. For the sake of comparison, I'm not shown here, at the end of 2024 cash came to 586.8 million Swiss francs, i.e. 45 million Swiss francs less. What is quite positive is operating cash flow before appropriation of nuclear provisions at 211.8 million. Despite a low-lower operating result, it is at the level of last year. In addition to influences from the valuation of energy derivatives, the seasonal increase in net current assets was lower than in the previous year by 76.5 and is at 102.3 million. And the reason for this is lower gas inventories. Cash use for the decommissioning and disposal of muleberg nuclear plant is more or less at the same level as last year at 50.2 million Swiss francs. I will delve a little bit deeper in the actual investments on the upcoming slides at 166.5 million Swiss francs cash flow from investing activities before central refunds was slightly lower than in the previous year. 17 million Swiss francs. What is important here is that the cash flow from operating activities was once again such that net investments could be covered. We received a Cenfo refunds in the amount of 33.4 million. The fact that as of the reporting date of 30th June, the refunds did not balance out the payments for the decommissioning and disposal is slowly attributable to timing differences in incoming and outgoing payments. The final payment for 2024 and the amount of 27 million wasn't transferred before 30th June, which is usually actually us. That means free cash flow was positive for the first half. The resulting free cash flow was not sufficient to finance the distributed dividends of 208 million, but it is sufficient if it does though by the end of the year. We therefore resorted primarily to our existing liquidity, and that is also the reason why the cash level is lower. Now let's take a look at the investments and where BKW has invested. In the first half year, investments in acquisition of group companies, property plant and equipment and intangible assets came to 226.7 million. And that's what's in the center here of that circle. It's about 4 million more than it last year. Of these, 54.2% were for growth, and 45% were 46% went to maintenance on the growth investments. In the energy solution segments, 59.9 million Swiss francs were invested in growth, 37.9 million or 38 million of these in wind and solar power generation. The remaining funds were spent on additional batteries, district heating or hydropower plants. In power grids, 30.1 million were invested in the growth of the strategic expansion of the power grid. In infrastructure and buildings, growth investments totaled about 33 million. These comprise the considerations for three companies that were acquired, as well as considerations for acquisitions in previous years and investments in organic growth. And maintenance sets in light blue of the 103.8 million, and that is traditional. Like a traditional 69.4 million was used for the power grid business. This overview shows you on the left hand side, the development of net debt on the maturity profile of our outstanding bonds and notes on the right hand side. Now, on the left hand side, you can see the net debt liquidity that's above the zero line. I've already mentioned what that is, but this now includes current financial assets, cash and cash equivalents. The financial debt at 1.9 billion remains stable. And as a result of the decline in cash and cash equivalents and the stable financial debt, our net debt rose seasonally by... A good 200 million to 1.084 billion on the reporting data that is slightly below previous years figure. Now, the maturity profile is relatively balanced. BKW holds an excellent diversification over time, and that means low financing risks, high flexibility and flexibility for future growth investments. And what's important for you, and that does not include in these figures, is the RCF, the syndicated RCF in the amount of 1 billion, which we renewed in spring 2024. It is a liquidity cushion, but we have not drawn it. It's not utilized. That's why it's not included in the figures. The RCF's term lasts until 2030, with a one-year renewal option and an accordion option of 0.5 billion. Thanks to our A rating, BKW's financial corset can be adjusted at any time according to our needs. Now, let's take a look at the balance sheet. Since the easing of tensions on the energy markets, the balance sheet has remained fundamentally stable with slight shifts between current assets and non-current assets and a slight decrease in total assets. Current assets have declined by 0.5 billion Swiss francs due to a lower level of cash and cash equivalents and lower inventories and receivables. Liabilities also decreased by 0.5 billion due to a lower level of accounts payable and customer premiums as well as lower tax liabilities. Equity declines slightly by about 70 million in the first half. There is a net profit of 203 million that increases equity while dividends distributed have corresponding contrary effect on equity. That was 208 million. That is why, ultimately, we also have actual real losses on defined benefit obligations and we also have slightly negative currency effects from currency translation. The equity ratio increases to a solid 59%, which will continue to bolster growth and our active role in shaping the energy transition. Finally, let me make a comment on the return on capital employed and the net debt to every ratio. ROCI is at 7.8% and thus markedly exceeds capital costs of BKW, leaving the record year 2023 out of the equation. ROCI can also be considered very stable. Turn to the right of the slide for the net debt to every ratio. Thanks to the stable EBITDA net debt, its euros in add a bit more than one, which is pre-crisis level. Now, with this, I'd like to close my part and shell hand back to Robert Echner for the outlook. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Martin. It's not quite usual that we sometimes also include political conditions. However, I please allow me to give you a brief overview because I think that the discussion is going on in the political realm have not decreased. No, the intensity is quite high and the energy industry is also affected. Let me mention four points here. For example, the procedures, acceleration bill or decrease. This is really important for us in order to implement the projects that we have agreed upon. So this is now almost there, almost at the finish line, but we're not yet there. So BKW is clearly promoting that this bill will reach a majority support in politics, because we are afraid if this is two one-sided, this might lead to detrimental impacts and might lead to delays. Then we've also discussed in politics very many times the rescue package. Certain companies were in trouble with their liquidity and that's why they got this rescue package. We were also part of this rescue package. However, basically BKW was and still is against the possibility that a state takes over responsibility. Maintaining sufficient liquidity is the core task of any company. We do this very gratifyingly and therefore it is our opinion that we should not delegate this task to a state or to our government. Therefore we do not want to pay a contribution. Then electricity agreement with the European Union. I do not want to go into all the details about our relationships with the European Union. However, let me state the following. This agreement is extremely important for the stability and the security of supply for Switzerland. We need access to the domestic energy market and we need energy. We need electricity during the winter months. This agreement will help us, will support us and the liberalization of the energy market will also be helpful. We will also gain efficiencies here in Switzerland due to this. And last but not least, the grid express is also very important for us so that we can expand the plants and the facilities. However, we think that the distribution grid should be considered to a greater extent. It is crucial for the energy transition. So that is why I included our political stance because these four points are time and again discussed in the political realm. Now about the outlook for 2025. We assume that we will have a stronger half year, second half year, be it in energy solutions but also in infrastructure and buildings. Power grid will remain very stable. In terms of energy solutions, we want to expand the renewable energy production. First of all, the price of the electricity has already been hedged at very gratifying prices. And we will be able to achieve further milestones, especially Chetiniola should be finished now. And this is certainly a milestone for us and will also make a contribution to our capacities. When it comes to the power grid segment, we want to advance digitalization, for example. This is really the basis for our cooperation with customers but also with other companies in order to offer grid friendly possibilities and enhance the flexibility. When it comes to the segment of infrastructure and buildings, we would like to focus on our past that we've chosen. We want to increase our profitability in the second half of the year. We have a very selective growth that we have chosen here and some units are already working profitably here. However, we also see that the markets in the mid and long term really offer great opportunities such as corporations in Germany. We've already mentioned that there is really a turbo booster that has been initiated in terms of the construction of residential homes. That is certainly something where we will play a park that is very important for our engineering, which is active in Germany as well. So we will have certainly infrastructure expansion to the tune of about 500 million. So within the next 12 or plus months we will be able to benefit from this boom. Now, we expect by the end of this year we will not be too much affected by geopolitical upheavals or disruptions. We are set up very gratifyingly and in a solid way. There will be some pressure on prices. However, we can still confirm our EBIT guidance of 650 to 750 million Swiss francs. We stand by this. Thank you so much. I'd like to hand over to Marisa for the Q&A. Thank you very much, Robert and Martin, for your explanations of the 2025 half-year results. And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for your questions. Now, before we get started, I would like to make a few organizational remarks with regard to the Q&A session. We kindly ask our guests here in this room to wait for the microphone before you ask your questions. And we also ask you to state your name and company before you ask your question. And to ensure that those participating in the live stream can hear the questions quite clearly, we also kindly ask you to hold the microphone close to your mouth and speak clearly. Thank you very much for this in advance. Now, are there already questions here in the room from the audience, please? Yes, please. Thank you. Good evening, English. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everyone. The first question is on the generation development. You mentioned the projects scrapped or confirmed, et cetera. But you have a question on the other main projects in Switzerland, in particular for green cell or tripped, if you have some update on that. And secondly, the moving parts for H2, if you can detail more the visibility of the evolution of H2, and in particular the sensitivity of the hybrid range. Now, in order to get the top end of the range or the mid range guidance, what are the moving parts by division, if possible. Some more granularity, if I may. And the third question is on networks. You mentioned in the presentation the report that there was a tariff reduction by Swiss grid. I think this was expected, but if you can add more color on this, I stop here for a time being. Thank you. Thank you very much for these questions. I shall repeat these questions in German. The moderator is now repeating the questions in German. I would like to hand over to Robert first of all. Well, Trift and Grimzel now. We have had a positive development here with the appeal that was withdrawn by Aquaviva, which affected this project. This is a major step that we achieved, and we are very happy about this. So there is still one organization who has initiated an appeal that's the Grimzel Association. However, on a national level, they are not entitled to advance their appeal, so that will be handled within the canton of burn. If everything goes smoothly, we might get started in 2029 with the construction. However, of course, there are certain questions that need to be answered first. Now with the Grimzel, nothing has changed concretely. KWO is intensively discussing with other NGOs. There are other balancing measures being discussed. And we do have a hope that we will get a consensus there so that we will be able to increase the dam wall of the second wall sometime in the near future. So this is about the status as it is right now to Grimzel and Trift. We also have Grimzel 4. This is a pump storage facility. Maybe I could add something to that. Here we have already received the concession, so we are in the preparation works for the construction of this pump storage facility. This will allow us to get more flexibility, which is quite important and welcome to us if we can reach it. It will be very positive if we can start construction in the next two to three years. The new construction of the Spittelum dam wall is also something that we've already started. We have a pipeline into the lake, so that means that we will be able to do this rather smoothly. Thank you, Robert, and the next two questions please over to Martin. Thank you. So you would like to get a bit more visibility on the guidance. First of all, we only would like to give you a range, and that is a very deliberate choice. I can only explain how this guidance or this range comes about. Of course, it's a bottom-up approach that we have here. If we give you a range, it is according to our best knowledge, and we probably reach about in the very middle of this range. But we very deliberately provide you with a range. So please bear with me that we cannot really tell you where exactly we will land within this range that we have given you. We have two things about the individual division or segments power grid, first of all. As I said, it's very stable. So plus, minus, we're not getting down to the individual million. However, the result will be stable at power grid. That is quite easily to estimate here. Now, the feed-through is very important to you how much electricity will be consumed in the second half of the year. So that very much depends on the weather conditions. So we have operating tariffs, they are active, they are established, that will influence, or that drives the power grid result. Then infrastructure and buildings from the past, we do know that the first half of this year did show some fluctuations, but it only makes up about a third of the result. So it depends what we can construct. Two thirds of this result will be generated in the second half. But please don't pin me down. This is a more or less estimation. How you can model the average range and energy markets, of course, is actually the part that is impacted by fluctuations. It really depends on the weather conditions that we have, whether it's limitations or not. So the production is the major part because prices are more or less hedged and fixed. So the level is more or less trading. In the second half of the year, we are very optimistic that we will increase this result. How do we know this today already? Because we do have positions and we know how they are positioned and they are already assessed and evaluated. However, there is a caveat that they have been valued at today's date or now. So the due date will be the 31st of December 2025. So there are evaluation or evaluation concerns that come into play. So as I said, trading, there are some uncertainties there, but that's the main lever for the second half of the year 2025. I do hope that these elaborations are of use to you. Great. And then the tariffs of Swiss grid. Now, for us, as long as the tariff changes are transferred on, we have a neutral result. So we get the burden by Swiss grid. However, we feed them on or we transfer them on. So energy procurement on the one hand side and energy supply on the other side. So this is neutral if these changes are always transferred on to the customers. There is, however, an impact that's what I showed on the slide. You will have an impact on the revenues, but not on EBIT because we hand them over or feed them through via both sides. Thank you very much, Martin, for your elaborations and explanations. Let's take a look at the live stream. We have a question of Robert Groeninger of UBS, stating the two initiatives that were recently submitted. And what are the legal risks? Now, the question connected with these initiatives against wind parks in Switzerland. Well, of course, BKW clearly rejects these two political initiatives. It would be a ban of wind farms and the locations that are good for wind farms do already have certain facilities. But these initiatives would mean that our targets in terms of wind power would be greatly diminished. And this is not a good development. In one of the initiatives, there is even a retroactive effect. And that means that some wind farms that have already been constructed would have to be dismantled. So this is completely not in line with the Swiss legal system to have such a retroactive effect. So it is not only a ban on new wind farms or a retroactive ban on wind farms, but it could also be expanded to the construction of roads and other infrastructure setups. So definitely, these are not in legal line with the Swiss legal system. Any further questions in this room? This is not the case currently. Yes, please. Mr. Rachperger. Thank you, Armin Rachperger. ZKB, Zurich Antonyl Bank. You have mentioned that the minimum remuneration for PV owners is amounts to six saltine per kilowatt-hour. Now, we very often have negative prices. We've seen negative prices. Now, if solar produces a lot, you will pay a lot of money. It seems, don't you feel bad about this? I mean, you will have to pay the six saltine per kilowatt-hour. So you have to pay the difference. Yes, someone has to pay the difference. It is clear. Is it those who consume electricity or not? In the long term, we will have a retroactive remuneration also vis-à-vis us ourselves, which is coupled to the market value more closely. So in the solar industry, this has been implemented. Now, in the long term, you do not have guaranteed tariffs at the very time when you need electricity. However, we decided that this is the Swiss Parliament decided on this, and it will apply as of 1 January 2026. So in the foreseeable time, we will have to work for this. There will be some reviews, or there are some reviews going on the timeline. Maybe it will be quarterly calculated. So there will be a lot of political discussions when it comes to the tariffing of the remuneration. And we are of the opinion, of course, that we need to consider and factor in the market development as well. Then the grid express has been mentioned. You'd rather get more finances for the distribution grid. Does that mean the promotion or the acceleration of high-voltage power lines? Well, if we do not factor in the distribution grid, I mean, it's not only about the promotion, but it's about the acceleration of these procedures. A truffle, for example, that is extremely important or necessary outside of certain areas. Is it still possible, for example, in isolated areas? Or if you have very densely populated areas, you will not have space to do this. So we need to adjust the procedures and adjust the procedures to the needs, and therefore the grid express bill is very important for that. Of course, every procedure has to be assessed and evaluated by many authorities, and maybe there might be one authority session that could be streamlined between various authorities, and therefore procedures could be accelerated. So you can imagine, if you, for example, want to connect a large PV system, it is very frustrating to wait for a connection that will only come in about three to four years time. That is not the goal of such facilities. Actually, key message, batteries, you have a stake in large battery storage facilities in Germany. So these large battery facilities, I mean, of course, it does make sense, but maybe your PV owners who probably should have batteries as well, and not pay these six something per kilowatt hours, and then you'll have the fluctuations in the grid. So don't you think that this is not correct, or do you rather view it as a business model to sort of capitalize on these fluctuations, really, large batteries? I think it will be both. Both of these things will be used. Batteries at home, storage facilities at home, in order to be autonomous in terms of energy consumption, that's certainly the best business case if you do not have to pay 30 something to be KW, but you can use your own battery that you have stored, and the large battery storage facilities, of course, mean that we can balance energy, and that means that the whole facility park, the power plant park, is changing greatly in Germany, but also in other countries, so that creates a huge need for battery storage facilities in order to balance out these requirements of the grid. So we are missing something on the production side because there are less, for example, coal power plants. There are many projects in this room. However, not all of them are proceeding very well everywhere. We have major discussions going on in terms of building permits and so on. So therefore, I think this is still very early on, but we are still seeing a lot of opportunities with the large battery storage facilities. I do have one last question, though, with regard to the electricity agreement. You have a lot of bound customers, so they will be, of course, affected by the liberalization of the electricity agreement, but in total you think this is a positive thing. Yes, I mean we did wait the interest, of course there are opportunities and challenges. We have to bundle the offers, and BKW will remain the owners of these systems with the liberalization. We will be able, or we will have to develop new tariff models. We have to be more attractive or attractive to our customers, but there is a lot of opportunity in there because we can react quickly to the market developments, so overall we think this is a major opportunity for BKW. Market access in Germany would be very difficult for us without an electricity agreement. This might not be very clear in Switzerland, the European grid is not controlled, or is controlled by price signals, and this is a fact, so we have to bear with that. So we have to take care that we do not have a completely different system in Switzerland because we are all very much interconnected. So power plants in Europe will not be used because the energy level will go down, but because of the price levels, and this works very well. The European grid is an extremely well-working system, one of the best in the world I can tell you. So just a few explanations and discussions of grids. I would like to go back to the live stream. And actually we would like to wrap it up in a few minutes, but there are questions that we would like to cover, Andreas von Aks, the production quantities in the second half of 2024, after 4.7 terawatt hours in the first half of 2024. So the terawatt value, terawatt hours, and will BKW be able to achieve this in the second half of 2025, and then a question whether the long outage of Gusgen has any impact on the production quantities in the second half year. Now in the second half year it was 5.9 terawatt hours in production, and please remember what I said, that the first half of 2024 was extraordinary, and of course we cannot exceed this in production in 2025. The first half of 4.7 last half year was 5.9, so we do not assume that we will repeat or be able to repeat what happened in 2024. Now question whether the outage of Gusgen had an impact or will have an impact on BKW has no stake in Gusgen, so it does not have an impact. There are three more questions in the live stream that we would like to answer. I would like to continue with two questions from Andreas von Aks, Bader Hervettia, BKW in the locked-in power price, will it still be 650 pranks per megawatt hour? For 2027 the price is already locked-in, and it is not 65, it is 60 pranks. So no change there, so it's as usual, that's the internal price, it's the price based on which you can calculate a production result, but what the trade does with these initial hedges during the following three years, and once they are delivered, this is something that is then reflected in the trading and portfolio management results. So that is something that trading does, if we didn't do that they wouldn't have those trading results. So it's 60 locked-in at 60 for 2027. Thank you Martin. And last question for Andreas von Aks, before we move on to the final question, the mean of the 2025 EBIT is at 700 million. The consensus for 2026 is at 830 million, so about plus 20% year-on-year. Is this something that BKW regards as realistic? Well the guidance for the following year is something that we are going to communicate at the annual conference, because we don't have the guidance for that time frame yet. But of course we have a strategy and we know where we're headed and that's what our orientation is. Okay, thank you Martin. And we have Julian Vichy from Bernice News. What went wrong with the terminal wind park? Well actually building construction activities were stopped. That was ordered by the authorities. Of course we do have our permits to continue, and then of course we are going to present our position to the building authorities of the canton of Bern. Well what went wrong? Well actually property owners do not want to give up. They want to stop the project. That is what went wrong. So thank you very much Robert. At this point we would like to close the conference on the half year results of BKW. On behalf of BKW I would like to thank you very cordially for your interest and for the guests here on site. We are happy to serve an upper road to you. And the final financial results will be presented on the 11th of March of 2026. And we would look forward to seeing you there again. Until then we wish you a wonderful autumn and of Vida Doga. Thank you.
