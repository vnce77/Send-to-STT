All right. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Jamie Purse. We're going to get started with our next session. We have Bryce Ring and Jen Phipps, CFO. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. I wanted to start. You just joined as CFO. You've been with the company a long time, but as you get to know the investor community, I just wanted to give you a chance to talk about your background and what you bring to the CFO seat that's new and helps the strategy of the company going forward. Sure. Thank you. I've been with the company for over eight and a half years, have been a part of everything that we've done over that time period in increasing sets of responsibilities, helped to lead a lot of processes like the IPO and a number of the transactions that we've done. So we've done 68 transactions over my tenure with Bryce Spring, 66 of those acquisitions are performing ahead of where we are. My team and some of the leadership that I've been able to provide, I think, has been very helpful to that. And so I just am excited with getting to continue in furthering my tenure with Bryce Spring and this role. Okay. Great. We'll get into some of the company stuff in a second. I wanted to take a moment just to address some of the uncertainty and confusion yesterday. Can you give us any contact for the confusion again that occurred intramarky yesterday? It's a really good question. We believe that our platform is very strong. We believe that there was really nothing from a market news perspective that we're aware of that would impact us. We did announce a secondary transaction yesterday evening after market. And so I think just those would be some of our thoughts as to why there might have been some market dynamics going on with our stock yesterday. Okay. And I'm sure you're pretty limited when you can say here, but is there a framework to think about how KKR might continue to work down their ownership over time and then post the secondary? Can you just remind us what percent ownership they have at this point? Yeah. So KKR has been a longtime supporter and owner of our business and they have been very supportive of Bryce Spring and our management team. They continue to be great partners to us, but really largely are serving just in a board capacity and doing those things. They will own, I think KKR is a portfolio company or KKR is a private equity company, has a balanced approach in how they do selldowns of their investments. And we have no reason to believe that they wouldn't be extremely balanced and in how they would approach an exit of Bryce Spring, but they continue to be very supportive of our company, the growth track record, and ultimately what we are going to deliver as a company. And they will own, they owned 53% prior, and so they'll just be under, if the green shoe is fully executed, they'll be a little bit over 44%. Okay. Let's turn now to the business. Coming out of the IPO, you guys, we have this roughly 8% top line, 8% EBITDA, we're a trajectory. It's been much better than that, you know, pharmacy's been a big part of that. Can you just, you know, kind of, you know, talk through what has surprised you most coming out of the IPO in terms of the outperformance, what wasn't in your guys' model that you, you know, kind of articulated publicly that has transpired to drive that performance? Yeah. So we believe that we have an attractive position serving home and community healthcare markets and we're a part of the solution, and we serve large and growing populations and markets that have high value in ROI. As we were coming into the IPO, we had had a long track record of growth that was a little bit higher than that, but as we scaled, we just wanted to be very balanced in what we believed that we could achieve. And so as we approach guidance, as we've approached even just at the start of the IPO, we wanted to have high confidence in our ability to achieve what we said we were going to do. And at that time, you know, we had very high confidence in our ability to beat, you know, and exceed those percentages. There have been some things that were more favorable than we anticipated. The LVDs that we've been able to win preferential access because of our quality in our specialty oncology business, we have done that at a greater acceleration. Those drugs have ramped in the marketplace faster than historically they have. Those have been, you know, some of the items throughout performance. We've continued to do M&A, largely tuck in, but we've been able to see growth in improvements in those acquisitions that have been greater than we expected. And then, you know, frankly, we've just been extremely focused on technology utilizing our scale to make sure that we are deploying best practices across all of our businesses. We were always focused on that, but we have been incrementally more focused on that. And that's just that I'm reviewing John Russo, our CEO is reviewing every single week, a list, a hundred long regarding every single project that we have in all of our different businesses, focusing on making sure we're utilizing the best technologies that we have the best processes that are contracts and the way we're procuring and utilizing, you know, whatever we're doing, it is at the most efficient and effective way. So we're just continuing to be all in on those areas as well. Okay. I'll come back to a couple of those points in a minute, but just you mentioned the track record longer term, you know, from 2018 to 2020, I think you grew revenue 18% and even up 13%, you know, really kind of consistent performance across many years. John often talks about just durability and sustainability when he's talking about the growth profile and performance of the business. How should we think about the track record you guys have, you know, built and, again, those words like sustainability, is that to say that type of profile is potentially achievable going forward or how would you just level set us on how to think about, you know, the performance continuing? Yes. Our strategy for the last eight years and continuing has been we want to lead on volume and we're doing that based on our quality and our outcomes that we're achieving. We believe that having the highest quality services allow us to achieve volume growth that are outsized to the market. So that's an area. We're focused on driving efficiencies and leveraging our scale and technology investments across our platform. We are focused in on doing a creative tuck in M&A, which enhances our growth profile. These have been winning, winning strategies for us. They have underpinned our long-term growth rates and when you exclude community living, the EBITDA growth rates are actually 15%, but 13% when you include that. And that's been for nearly a decade. So we just continue to execute on our strategy that we've continued to execute on over the last several years and we believe that's a winning strategy for us. Okay. And one question I often get asked, I mean, you guys painted a picture of, you've got very complimentary services across a number of end markets. How should we think about just the synergy that creates, how much cross-selling opportunity there is how much cross-selling is leading today and just, you know, I guess even bigger picture, the rationale for these businesses being together? Yes. Yes. So as we think about the populations that we're serving, largely seniors with the divestiture of the community living business, we are focused in on serving the many needs of the highest populations or the highest concentration of those seniors and they need provider services, they need pharmacy solutions and they need home-based primary care that's able to step in front of and unlock some of those opportunities across, you know, with the dock holding the pen. And so we believe that that provides better outcomes for our patients, which leads to higher ROI and cost savings to the systems and we're focused in. But I would say, you know, from a core strategy, going back to what we were focused in on, quality leads to volume growth, we are focused on that individually within each of our different needs. And then as we, you know, cross over and have patients that are in that have multiple different needs, which we do, how can we serve as many of those needs as possible? So in our hospice pharmacy, all of our hospice patients receive their meds from our hospice pharmacy or our hospice patients receive all of their pharmacy needs from our hospice pharmacy. So that's one example of where we're doing that. We have home health patients, we have a new medication management program called Continue Care RX. We implemented that probably about a year ago. We had a paper published in JAMDA, which is a peer reviewed medical journal showing that individuals that receive our Continue Care RX program, so medication and medication adherence processes and services, and receive home health have a 72% greater reduction in hospitalization as compared to just average home health patients. That is really significant. Now there's lots of reasons why not all home health patients are on our Continue Care RX program. There are things we're working through with payers related to making sure you get the appropriate rates for those programs, but those are the types of programs that we think are differential and will be really important as we, you know, move forward and, you know, really try to drive costs out of the system. Yeah, and that's one kind of tangible example today. How do you think about just, you know, unlocking more of these types of synergies across the business and serving an individual patient with multiple service funds? How much more, you know, opportunity do you see in the medium term? Yeah, no, I think we see a lot of opportunity. Our home-based primary care business and those are largely nurse practitioners that are going into the homes where patients are, whether it's a senior nursing facility or into their actual home, we believe the expansion of that business will help unlock even more opportunities for us across the business. So these, I think, like, docs at home or, you know, nurse practitioners that are going in, they're able to step in front of issues that patients might have that reduce hospitalization. But primary care doctors will depend and typically have a lot of influence, you know, in what our patients would have. And so we continue to build out services. So we've talked a little bit about, you know, another example of an area that we're expanding in our rehab business. We have started expanding into Part B rehab for seniors. And that's, we're in the early innings of what that looks like. But we have, we have patients that have primary care services that could be receiving our home health services that are getting rehab services if they're not on the home health benefit that are in the senior nursing facilities where we're providing the drugs. So it's really about, you know, access and we think better coordinated care that, that again is the reason you do this and, and we're also doing this in order to be able to begin unlocking differential payment plans and on from a value-based care strategy perspective. So again, we're in the early innings of that. But as we, as we are producing outcomes that are driving cost reductions in the system, we believe that we can, we should be able to share in those savings. And so in 2024, we started, we started a partnership or started in a partnership with one of the largest ACO providers and we're docked to some of the high-speed patients in their plan. And we're just starting down this path, but, but we believe that there are a lot of opportunities so that's a, that's a Medicare plan. We did buy a little, I snip and it's in just a couple of states, but that's an MA capability that we have from a value-based care standpoint. And as we think about, you know, how do we leverage our access to patients, you know, across our different, you know, service lines, you know, how, again, how do we drive those, those items? And then how do we work with our payers that we have to help manage their, their patients as well? So those are all items that, you know, we think are beneficial. Well, you brought up the primary care opportunity, so maybe we can go there next. There's a lot of primary care, you know, models out there and many companies have, you know, talked about this market, many with very mixed results. So how should we think about your ventures in primary care and how you build that thoughtfully, how you, you know, make it durable and what's differentiated about this compared to, you know, other companies that are trying to build primary care capabilities? I think what's differentiated for us is that we have a lot of the other service lines that our doctors are then able to help connect. So we see this as being really important in helping connect our different service lines together. And again, these docs oftentimes hold the pen related to referrals and are helping, you know, patients always have choice, but, but, you know, we believe our services are strong and help give our patients just a view and are able to step in front of, step in front of, you know, any issues they would have. I think, again, our ability to take the services that we do provide all connected together and help layer that into, you know, to an ACO or an ICNIP strategy and help get differentiated payment that help pay for these services, I think those are very valuable. And something that we're able to do, or are seeking to do a little bit differentially to maybe how others have done it. You also mentioned alternative payment models and here too, especially. There's been very mixed results in the market and it's been harder, I think, for many to take risk effectively, you know, versus, you know, I think people thought a few years ago, how should we think about, you know, how your approach layering on risk? You know, I think it's pretty small today, like 5,000 patients, upside-only contracts. But where does that go from here, you know, both in terms of the types of risk, as well as, you know, the opportunity, how much savings you think you're leaving on the table. Our models are largely upside models and we're really not taking risks, you know, outside of the one very small ICNIP plan and we're doing that very carefully. We've been the doctors in that practice and associated with that ICNIP for lots of years. And so we have a history, you know, and understand, you know, those patients really well. So again, we're trying to tread very carefully as we would in anything and we're doing this in as risk-free away as we think that we can and really just trying to capture some of the upside associated with the value that we're driving in the chain. Okay. And shifting gears a little bit. You mentioned all the M&A the company has done over the years and you being a big part of, you know, that process and continuing to focus on it. Yeah. How should we think about, you know, where you guys are at in terms of approaching M&A today? You've got a lot of different service lines, very broad from a geographic perspective as well. Where are you finding opportunities today or most focus on adding density or scale within your model? So, you know, as we discussed, we have a really strong track record of M&A and how we're able to integrate that well and improve on the quality and the financial performance of the acquisitions that we do. We have a very strong pipeline that's very long. The majority of all of the deals that we do are proprietary based on longstanding relationships that we have throughout all of our different businesses. So we have relationships and theoretical deals that we might be working on for five years. Relationships that we're building, understanding the best, highest quality providers in markets, building relationships with them, and then, you know, staying close to them over whatever time period that would be. And John Russo, our CEO, is very involved in that process as well and all of our different business line leaders in identifying who are the best people in the business and just making sure we're staying close to them. So that pipeline has never been longer. We've been very balanced in the M&A that we've done, largely focused on tuck-ins over the last couple of years as we've focused on deleveraging, which is a critical priority for us. But we've been able to do still a number of M&A transactions that we think have been very accretive and beneficial to us. And obviously, it's an uncertain environment for a variety of reasons. What's your perspective on just where buyers and sellers are in terms of getting across the finish line, where multiple SARS, any contacts you can share on what you're seeing in the landscape. Most of our transactions are very small, very small tuck-in acquisitions. And so, you know, from time to time, different things happening from a regulatory standpoint can impact what is available in the market. But I would say, you know, most of our deals are probably not necessarily impacted by that so much. And, you know, again, we just stay very close. We have a line of sight to, you know, a number of different targets. We know who the best players are. We have a very targeted approach from a corporate development standpoint, understanding what markets we think make sense. Where do we want to be in home health that we're not? Where do we want to be in hospice that we're not? From a rehab perspective, what are the next couple of companies that we think are just really great players. Again, focus on small smaller tuck-in deals has traditionally been what we've done. You know, every once in a while, and interesting, you know, more medium-sized acquisition has come along and has been very interesting to us. And, you know, certainly we would consider those. But there's not really anything that is significant that we're focused in on, and certainly nothing from a platform perspective that we feel like we need at this time. Okay. And on the other side of the spectrum, announce the divestiture of the community living business. I guess just give us your perspective on the rationale for that transaction and how it positions the, you know, remaining business going forward. Yeah. So we love that community living business. We believe that we're a high-quality operator that has performed really well in this space. But as we think about where we want to be focused as an organization, we've been focusing over the last several years, primarily from a senior standpoint and focusing on developing really in clinical areas from a health services perspective. And as we just were thinking about where do we want to be, we just felt like that particular asset made sense with a different buyer. And we were approached and ultimately the transaction made sense. But again, we love that business. We think, you know, that the work that that business is doing, you know, is high-quality work and is extremely important. There's actually not a better ROI in our company than the ROI that those services provide to states and to those patients. So. Okay. Maybe turning to the businesses specifically, I'll start with pharmacy, but I want to go to provider, you know, I think you were a CFO of the home health and office business there. So I'll spend some time there as well. On pharmacy, you mentioned that LDDs and how important that's been to the group profile, you know, those ramping quicker than expected. You've talked about, I think, 18 or so over the next 18 months. How should we think about, you know, this type of cadence of LDDs and contribution going for the sustainability of the LDD, you know, portion of the story? Yes. So there are over 400 oncology therapies that are in Phase 3 at the FCA. We continue to see just a growth in that, you know, in those pipelines. And we've also seen that in the oncology space, there has, and rare and orphan, there has been just a narrowing of networks to a limited distribution standpoint. It, these, these are often high touch drugs that are life changing, life altering drugs that require really just high touch and, and real focus in delivering and making sure that patients are getting what they need. And they're staying on the medication from an network. And again, we see that largely in specialty oncology related to oral and injectables. And we continue to have really great NPS scores, promoter scores, net promoter scores, both from a patient and a provider standpoint, very high quality services. We get drugs to patients faster than almost anyone, you know, in the specialty pharmacy industry. And we believe that this is the reason we're winning preferential treatment in this limited drug distribution networks, as those are coming to market. And, and across your specialty visit, is there a way to decompose growth between existing drugs and those just, you know, maturing in their typical life cycle versus new to portfolio drugs and just the breakdown of contributions? So as you think about limited LDDs, you typically see it's a ramp from a curve perspective. And so you just have to layer all 127 LDDs. And they're in different places, curve typically. It is not very early in the life cycle that they're ramping. So it takes some time for doctors to understand what that new drug is doing to sales forces for the manufacturers. Our sales forces are going out and educating. So we typically see classes of drugs that might have been LDD wins in 2023. They're still ramping in 2025. Some of our 2022 drugs ramping in 2025. So, so we have seen an acceleration where information is getting out there much quicker that, you know, we think doctors are getting educated faster. I think our sales force has been helpful in that as well. And making sure people understand what these new drugs are available in doing. And we're seeing those that continued growth. But again, we don't see that pipeline slowing down. But, you know, certainly I think we have good visibility into the next, you know, 12 to 18 months as you stated. Okay. And obviously there's a lot of focus on most favorite nation, you know, drug pricing in general. How are you guys thinking about potential impacts on your on your business and the mechanics of how that impacts reimbursement for you? Yeah. So we we think of most favorite nations really more potentially deeper, maybe not deeper. It's it's more like IRA. I guess as we think about what is happening. And a number of those drugs that would be on any top list are already on the IRA list. And as we have sized and framed that for for people that are following us, we really think about those impacts as being more limited and confined to the home and community pharmacy space. And less unmitigated, there would be an impact to the pharmacy, the long term care pharmacy space. But we believe that individuals, you know, on the Hill in Congress at CMS, we do not believe that the pharmacies were the target of of the IRA impacts or MFN impacts were the last mile to the home. We have very thin margins. And we are helping reduce cost and help patients stay on the drugs. So, you know, we're confident that or I guess we feel that it's very important that ultimately from a pharmacy perspective that that there will be some mitigation that will occur. Will that occur via a dispensing fee and enhance the dispensing fee that that could take place? We believe that one area of those are conversations that we've had with with people on the Hill and the CMS, it could be that manufacturers reduce cost or some combination, you know, of all of those things. And I guess from the home and community pharmacy, which you said is maybe where this would be most impactful, is there a framework you're able to share in terms of how to think about potential impact. So, you know, what we've said is that we believe that, you know, our balance and our scale, our balance portfolio, which is very complementary and diversified, and the scale that we provide I think is going to allow us to navigate this certainly much better than obviously we were just the long-term care pharmacy. And as we framed it, we still believe that, you know, we will be able to achieve our long-term historical growth rate and that, you know, otherwise this is probably a couple of percentage points of West completely unmitigated, at least related to IRA in 2026, a couple percentage points of of e-badog growth for us that we would otherwise have. But again, you know, we do feel confident that people understand this issue and that from a pharmacy perspective, the pharmacies are the last miles of the home and are very important from a value chain standpoint. Okay, let's let's go to the provider business for a few minutes. Yeah, you know, there's I think four core businesses that remain after the community living to vestiture. You know, overall growth was 12% in the first quarter, which is certainly above end market growth. Can you help us think about, you know, which businesses are driving that growth? What's driving, you know, kind of obvious market share gains and, you know, just give us a little more context for what's driving that. Yeah, so as we think about our provider business, we've broken that out post community living to three sub-segments, our home health care segment, which is made up of our home health hospice and primary care business, our rehab business and our personal care business. As we think about our home health care segment, we see good market growth and we expect that to grow outside or we're focused on initiatives that will allow us to grow outside to the market, which is beneficial. And a number of initiatives that we've tried to hopefully would expand margin there. As we think about our rehab business, we also think about that as a double digit growth business as well. And that's a really great business. We're focused in on growth in certain areas, like VA and some other payer relationships. But that is definitely not most of the growth is coming from our other business lines as we think about that business. So again, that's a very steady business. We like that business a lot. We think it's very complimentary to the other services that we're providing. But that business is a little bit lower of a growth rate. Okay, your guidance for this year implies like 10 to 14% growth, you know, which is consistent with the first quarter. Are there unique tailwinds in 25 that we should think about, you know, fading and as we get into 26 and just longer term broadly or, you know, as we think about that guidance as a baseline to think about, you know, more more durable growth. Now, we are definitely focused in on, you know, continuing that growth and making sure that the growth we have underpinned by the quality services that we offer would be outside to the market. And we think the quality services we're offering have allowed us to do that historically. We look to do that into the future. There are things that we're expanding into like part B rehab that I mentioned that we think, you know, can provide tailwinds from a growth perspective, you know, and as we scale, we'll help continue to allow that growth rate to be outside to the market. Again, as our home base primary care and that business line continues to expand. And we start to see shared savings. We believe that that will also provide growth that will allow us to achieve our longer term growth rate in that segment. Okay. Maybe we can turn to margins, you know, overall corporate margins have gone from, you know, roughly low sixes to, you know, into the fours. I think a lot of that has been driven by mixed. So I guess first question, can you talk about the underlying margins and not not at the reported segment because we kind of know those but even deeper. I mean, are there margin pressures within some of the businesses or, you know, how much of this is mixed versus, again, underlying margins? Yes, we are focused. So it is, we have had outside growth compared to the rest of our company, which we think has been very good growth, very great, really great growth, you know, comparatively. We have seen outside growth in our specialty pharmacy business and that business has the lowest margins within our portfolio and I think within the industry. And so as we've had really outsized growth in that, outside to our other business lines growth, that has absolutely impacted our margin. We're focused and really think about margin at each different individual business line level. We're thinking about it in terms of where do we think it should be? And then how do we make sure that we're expanding that in the best ways? What are the, what are the things? What are our competitors margins look like? And we really have goals set at each different business line level and are focused on making sure that we're expanding those at, you know, in each of those different areas. You know, certainly, you know, on the pharmacy side, we've been focused in on making sure we have, you know, you have payer, you have payer impact each year that we work to offset via cost or efficiency or processes. And those are very important to us every single year to make sure, you know, that we would offset any, any impacts that you might have from a rate perspective. You typically have a more favorable rate, rate impact on the provider side. As we've seen historical, we've seen historically rate increases across the provider segment, largely. And as you do that analysis comparing your margins to peers and individual business lines and just generally evaluating where there's margin opportunity, where are you most focused in terms of, you know, improving, you know, segment or business line level margins in the next, you know, 12 to 18 months? Yes. The areas that we're most focused in on that we see opportunities for improvement are in our long term care pharmacy, as well as in our home infusion pharmacy. Those are probably the two areas that that we're most focused in on as, you know, we have other rate pressures and other things that we're doing. So, so home infusion is a little bit more nuanced. We have taken the last year and a half to make pre significant investments into an op model that we believe will help that we'll be able to then leverage and and help us move forward from a growth perspective. So that's that's a that's an area where we believe there's definitely a lot of opportunity for us to expand and grow and we spent the last year and a half really thinking about the operating model as we focus on both the acute and chronic side and really made some investments in that area. So we're really excited about what we how we think we're going to be able to move off, you know, move forward, I guess, relative to those investments in the coming years and and we've stated that, you know, we would be disappointed if we didn't have significant growth in that in that particular business. So we see a lot of opportunities there both in terms of margin expansion and growth. And then from a long term care pharmacy, you know, headed into IRA, we are very focused in on making sure that we obviously we're working on, you know, what offsets we can have from a congressional standpoint, from a payer standpoint, from from a cost standpoint. But then separately, what are the things we need to be doing to make sure that we would have a list of 10 or 15 or 20 projects to help us offset what those costs would be, those impacts might be, you know, if they were completely unmitigated. How are you thinking about GNA just, you know, the cost needed to support the business, obviously, there are variable costs in there just as you, you know, grow the business. What investments do you need to make and then what efficiency and offset, you know, opportunities, do you see? I think we've been very balanced over the last several years investing in growth, investing in technologies that we that have set us up well for growth into the future. So, you know, as I think about home health and hospice over the last, it was probably three years ago, we invested in one system across, that's an area we're very acquisitive in. We had a handful of different systems, a different operating system. We spent the time, the energy, getting onto one platform, every acquisition in our home health and hospice space, you know, now come into that platform and that acquisition that allows us to better leverage our processes, better leverage our infrastructure, make sure we have the right reporting, such as one example, but those are things that we've done. So from a cost perspective, I think there's a lot of leverage that we'll have from a growth perspective, but you're right, they're absolutely, you know, will be incremental investments that we'll want to continue to make, both from a quality, you know, and as we grow, that's an area we just have continued to invest in quality, quality resources, making sure we have those right processes, those right systems. Okay, and I think we're at time, but one to close just very quickly guidance of 570 to 585 for the year, how are you guys thinking about the range and just, you know, business performance relative to that at this point in the year? Yeah, so we, from a guidance perspective, our philosophy is to be to have high confidence in our ability to really like deliver the range that we are doing that and make sure that we have line of sight to sort of every single thing that's going to allow us to be within that range. So, so we are performing really well, we continue to be performing really well and, and, you know, feel like, you know, we're doing everything we can to set ourselves up for really good performance for 2025. Great. I think we can conclude there. Thank you so much for joining. Thank you.
