You would then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded on Thursday, August 29th, 2024. I would like now to turn the conference over to Eric Rivera, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our review of Photronics fiscal 2024 third quarter results. Joining me this morning are frankly our Chief Executive Officer and Chris Proogler, our Chief Technology Officer. The press release we issued earlier this morning together with the presentation material that accompanies our remarks are available on the investor relations sections of our webpage. Comments made by any participants on today's calls may include four looking statements that include such words as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast and interview. These four looking statements are based upon a number of risks on certainties and other factors that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the four looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the four looking statements after the date of the presentation to conform these statements to actual results. During the course of our discussion, we will refer to certain non-gap financial metrics. These numbers are useful for analysts, investors and management to evaluate ongoing performance. A reconciliation of these metrics to gap financial results is provided in our presentation materials. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter sales can be lighter than we expected due to a soft demand from Asia or Foundry as a strong order rate at the beginning of the quarter loss momentum. Linkering macro uncertainty and customer concern on elevated inventory caused some to limit or defer reducing new designs. As a result, photo mass demand slow, resulting in lower sales for both IC&L and FPD. Higher logic mass orders decrease via our memory business improving the quarter. Iron FPD improved due to demand for MLA masks used for mobile displays as companies prepare for model release in a recovering smartphone market. Compared with the second quarter, growth margin decreased due to the impact of lower revenue. Operation expenses was slightly lower than the second quarter. EPS was 55 cents. After adjusting for an FX gain, long gap EPS was 51 cents higher than mass quarter and the same as last year. We continue to generate strong operation cash, giving us added flexibility to invest in growth, while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. As a result, we are announcing an increase of our existing shared repurchase program to $100 million. Eric will share details in few minutes. But we believe this is the right time to restart our shared repurchase activity and enhance our capital allocation framework. Based on our optimism in the long-range photo mass market, we are also evaluating similar growth options, including strategic expansion, partnerships, and other possibilities in US, Europe, and Asia. We are maintaining flexibility to act quickly in support of our global customer and partners, while remaining disciplined to ensure our investment meets financial objectives. I am very proud. I am very pleased with the way our team has performed during the quarter. They have taken care of the customers, while managing costs and maximizing cash to maintain financial strength. We have a great team at Fortronis, and they are navigating the challenges well. Turning to the market, I would like to comment on the trend we have seen. Photo mass demand is driven mostly by design activity. Several long-term trends, such as AI, mobile computing, and increase IC content in automotive, energy, and consumer applications, drive new designs in both leading-edge and legacy technology nodes, all required in new photo mask. As the global leader in IC mask units, we see a high level of new product qualification across the node spectrum, each with projected revenue opportunities. It is all pre-wares to our marginal strength and is a positive long-term trend for our business. In addition to new designs, photo mask demand is driven by an increase in wafer manufacturing capacity. New ferm are being built globally to meet the growth in applications, such as data centers that are needed to support AI, and to support an increase in supply chain regionalization. This is a positive long-term trend for photo mask demand. Due to our broad geographical footprint, capacity, and suite of technologies, we are able to provide all of our customers photo mask needs. We are surprisingly all leading budget firms with strong market share, especially in Taiwan, China, and Korea. In US and Europe, we are seeing the initial signs of global demand for regionalization. Turning to display, innovation is mostly due to new futures in mobile displays and to a lesser degree new TV technology that improve performance. On a mobile display, this trend was largely supported by new premium smartphones, higher screen resolution, and the need to aid additional functions, such as fingerprint sensor and cameras, while reducing power, require new advanced mask sets. MRA continues to be introduced into larger-sized screens, such as tablets and laptop, and the development is on the way to produce MRA on G8.6 graphs. These trends all require high-quality photo mask. As the technology leader in FCD mask, we are well positioned to benefit from these trends and growth. While near-term demand is being challenged by dynamic market conditions, we remain optimistic regarding the long-term market outlook. Our competitive advantage, including strong customer relations, long-term purchase agreements, leading technology, and broad global capacity, position us to continue to all grow the photo mask industry. Our ability to control costs and manage cash allows us to continue to invest in profitable growth and deliver shareholder value. At this moment, I will turn the call to Eric to review our third-quarter results and provide fourth-quarter guidance. Thank you, Frank. Third-quarter revenue of $211 million was down 3% sequentially with market softness across both I.C. and death beating. I.C. revenues decreased 3% quarter over quarter. High-end was lower as improved memory sales where not enough to offset lower demand from logic boundaries in Asia. Compared with the third quarter of 2023, high-end improved on strong U.S. sales, high-end growth continues to be a factor for us as we see customers migrating to smaller design nodes, including 22 and 28 nanometers to take advantage of the cost and performance benefits. At the leading edge, our special 2B business continues to grow. The year-to-day high-end I.C. revenue is up 23% demonstrating our success in growing this segment of our business. Mainstream, once again, achieves sequential growth as demand improved, particularly in the U.S. This further validates our belief that Q1 of this year was the bottom of the mainstream downturn, and we anticipate additional growth going forward. FPD revenue was lower sequentially as well. On a positive note, high-end resumed growth with improved demand for mobile AMOL displays. Overall, display industry dynamics remain somewhat soft, largely due to the same factors that are impacting semiconductor demand. As uncertainty awaits, we anticipate achieving above-market growth due to our leading technology, scale, market share, and strong customer relationships. Overall, our growth margin was 35.6%. That was slightly, as we would expect, given the softer revenue and our level of operating leverage. Lended ASP held up well as price increases implemented in previous year's whole firm. Our long-term purchase agreements continue to provide protection against downside risk during times of market softness, helping us maintain market share and pricing. Delivery premiums, which were meaningful last year, are no longer material to our results as lead times have normalized. Operating expenses were slightly lower, quarter over quarter, with operating margins compressing around 110 basis points to 24.7%. Despite softer revenue through the first nine months of 2024, we have maintained strong margins with the year-to-date operating margins of nearly 26%. Below the operating line and excluding the impact of FX gain, we achieved non-gap net income of 32 million, or 51 cents per share, ahead of last quarter and the same as last year. We generated 75.1 million in operating cash flow, and CAPX was 24.4 million in the quarter. Year-to-date CAPX is 87.7 million. We expect four-year CAPX to be 130 million, 10 million lower than we previously estimated, as some of the CAPX payments will not occur until next year. Our CAPX will support anticipated demand growth, primarily in multi-note I.C. capacity and capability, and to continue replacing aging tools. All while ensuring we are increasing our return on invested capital. Looking ahead to 2025, we see opportunities to continue investing in growth, primarily in I.C. to ensure we are well positioned to capitalize on the positive long-term megatrends that are driving total mass demand. We will provide specific 2025 CAPX guidance during our Q4 earnings fall in December. We further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter, increasing the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments to $606.4 million. Total debt, primarily for equipment leases in the U.S., was reduced to $20.1 million. With our strong balance sheet and demonstrated ability to generate cash, we are increasing the size of our share repurchase program to $100 million and plan to restart activity under the program soon. We believe this is a good use of cash and will add value to our shareholders. Before providing guidance, I'll remind you that demand for products is inherently uneven and difficult to predict, with limited visibility and typical backlog of 1 to 3 weeks. In addition, ESPs for advanced mass sets are high, meaning a relatively low number of high-end orders can have a significant impact on our quarterly revenue and earnings. With those qualifications, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of 213 to 221 million. While we are seeing good order rates at the beginning of the fourth quarter, lingering macro uncertainty is keeping us cautious. Based on those revenue expectations and our current operating model, we estimate non-gap earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 48 to 54 cents per diluted share. This equates to an operating margin between 25 and 27% as we continue to keep costs under control and maximize profitability. We deliver sequentially higher adjusted EPS in the third quarter, even as demand remains soft. This was achieved by keeping a tight control cost. We also continue to generate strong cash flow, keeping our balance strong and enabling us with less than growth. As demand on our markets improves, we are in a great position to grow revenue and expand margins. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star 1-1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw the question, please press star 1-1 again. Our first question will come from Tom Difley with DA Davidson. Your line is now open. Yes, good morning and thank you for taking a few questions. Eric, I was curious when we go through the results and how earnings kind of held in there despite the weaker revenue, it looks like a combination of tax and the non-controlling interest for the big drivers there. Maybe we can talk about each one on tax. Why did it fall as much as it did? And then on non-controlling, do the China percentage fall quite a bit? And if that's the case, is the profitability in China not where you want it to be quite yet? Thanks. Sure, Tom. Thanks for the question. So from a tax perspective, what effective task was the jurisdictional mix of earnings? Similar to the non-controlling interest. So our joint ventures didn't perform as well. We would have liked them to perform, so as a result, there was less income attributed to them. However, that was offset by some of our wholly ill subsidiaries. So as our wholly ill subsidiaries, as the mix between earnings between our wholly ill subsidiaries and our joint ventures, goes more towards our wholly ill subsidiaries, shareholders of photonics benefit from additional EPS gains. So maybe to summarize, when you do projects in North America or outside of Asia, the tax rates are better and the profitability is better? So even within Asia, there's certain jurisdictions that just have different tax rates. So as that jurisdictional mix changes, as you have more income and lower tax jurisdictions, you benefit from a tax perspective. Okay, great. And a couple more here. So notice that SG&A was up quite a bit, scored over quarter despite the revenue dip, maybe a little color there. Sure. So our SG&A was primarily increased due to professional services, fees that were incurred during the quarter. Okay, I guess that leads me to my next question. Any update on the general council dismissal? And does that have any impact outside of federal services? There was certainly no impact to our financial results, no significant impact, I should say. No update further than that though at this time. Okay, and then just one broad question. When you look at the margin structure on the mature, the mainstream business and how, over the last few years, it's ramped nicely. It kind of peaked maybe a year ago. Is the mainstream business still healthy from a price point of view or has the softness in the overall transaction run rate, put it back into its old kind of sequentially declining on an annual basis? Tom, this is Frank. Our mainstream business actually is very stable because as we report several times in the core, in the mainstream manufacturing side, there are many end-of-life tools. So with that, we have to replace the equipment to add capacity, but in general, the capacity for mainstream segment is not increasing. So that enable us to keep the stable price. Okay, great. And then I don't know if Chris is on the call, but I do have a kind of technology question. Yeah, I'm here, Tom. Oh, hey, Chris. So you guys, two things. First, what do you think the longer-term impact is if any of Apple, canceling is micro-display project? And then how do you see OLED ramping into flat panels of a larger size over time? Yeah, so the micro-display, we don't really see much impact on micro-display. We didn't have it marked up as a big growth driver for photo masks. So to the extent companies like Apple decide not to commit to micro-display, does not really change our outlook on the FPD market. As far as the OLED, definitely we see the Gen 8.6 form factor starting to go into production next year, we believe. One of the large panel makers already has that fab. And we're talking to them about shipping initial masks into that. We do think we'll be in a good POR position for those high-form factor masks. And the ASPs for those, because they're tough masks to make, AMOLED at Gen 8.6, much harder, much more complex than LCD, we'll see really good ASPs on those products. Okay, and I assume that you have a bit of a technology advantage over some of your newer peers in that space as well. Yeah, for sure on FPD, we think we have pretty strong technology lead. The other thing we see on AMOLED is a lot of take-up of so-called advanced masks, things that, you know, not to use jargon, but face-shifting masks, and the types of technology that really helped IC evolve through Moore's law. We're seeing the adoption rate on those for flat panel increase quarter over quarter. So a really good take-up on our higher-end masks to get more performance on panel. So we think our tech leadership here is going to be a big advantage. Great. Okay. Well, thank you, Eric, Frank, and Chris. Appreciate your time today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I show no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Frank Lee for closing comments. Thank you. Thank you for joining us this morning. While demand has been solved through the first nine months of 2024, we have done a great job of maintaining margins and generating strong cash. I'm proud of the way we have performed. Looking longer-term, there are several megatrends that show support market growth. As the Indian photo mass producers, we are well positioned to grow as demand improves, creating value for our customer, employee, and shareholders. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. Thank you.
