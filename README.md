Good morning and welcome to the Mobius Investment Trust PLC Investor presentation. Throughout the quarter presentation, investors will be in listen-only mode. Questions are encouraged and they can be submitted at any time by the Q&A tab situated in the right and corner of your screen to simply type in your questions and press send. The company may not be in a position to answer every question it received in the meeting itself, however the company can review the questions for today and publish responses where it's appropriate to do so. Before we begin I'd like to look at the following poll. I'd now like to hand you a founder and portfolio manager Carlos van Hartenberg. Good morning yourself. Good morning to all of you and thank you very much for dialing into our webinar this morning. We are yet again going through a period of global uncertainty. We are going through a period where external factors are driving sort of a risk on risk of environment changing almost every hour. So nothing has changed to that extent compared to what we experienced over the past couple of years. And I would like today to focus on the opportunities which this type of situation is providing. I would also like to spend time today on the investment trust and how we invest what type of companies we believe are best positioned to deliver returns over the next five years. And of course the environment is requiring special attention to external risk factors, to geopolitical factors, to macroeconomic drivers which are determining the value of currencies and emerging markets, the value of commodities, the appetite for risky assets. But I would also like to say right at the beginning we should never lose sight, especially in these times of the actual opportunities, the idiosyncratic opportunities which are being developed by entrepreneurs in emerging markets. And these are the opportunities which are generating the groundwork for business models we will read about and hear about more and more in the future. They are building fantastic teams, they are building fantastic models, they are expanding into new markets and emerging markets in general, especially Asia, has more and more of these companies which are competing globally, more companies of such nature than ever before and especially in India. But across Southeast Asia as well we are finding very strong companies which are in our pipeline. Now of course the big question is why emerging markets at all, why bother with this asset class? And of course all of us will have observed over the last decade that many developed markets, especially tech oriented markets, the US market of course, have generated far better returns, not the whole world, not everything and also it depends with what you compare it to if you include China which is a big part of the emerging market universe and include that in the reference, of course the performance especially over the last 10 years doesn't look very appealing. Now I would like to again take this time and this opportunity to focus on fundamentals, number one earnings growth and maybe before I do this I should also point out that many emerging markets over the last five, seven, 10 years have in fact generated outstanding returns, outstanding performance even compared to some of the best performing developed markets. It's just that the average and especially the inclusion of China has been dragging down emerging market performance over the last decade. We believe it's now time where we reached an inflection point where the combination of valuations, the combination of excessive valuations also in some developed markets and the continuation of operational performance of underlying companies in emerging markets coupled with strong and resilient macroeconomic conditions can lead to a decoupling and yet again a prolonged phase of outperformance in emerging markets. Of course part of this will be also driven by flows, the return of flows into this asset class but having said this let's just look at these main building blocks here which we think will be the ultimate pillars of strong performance earnings growth. So emerging markets just for 2025 and 2026 we're seeing 14 and 16% growth and earnings on average which is far outpacing developed markets. Of course you know GDP growth after the prolonged period of difficulty under COVID after sort of Trump 1.0 we are seeing that GDP growth across emerging markets is recovering so pretty strong numbers especially compared to the US of course also Europe so we're looking at double if not triple the growth numbers. Demographics are well understood a young population very large and dynamic populations which are in the most fruitful part of their sort of age bucket. Overall also important the prospects of weakening US dollar we've seen the first phase of this with the beginning of the Trump administration so year today the decline of 6% and emerging markets tend to outperform in periods of dollar weakness. I wouldn't suggest that it is necessary and essential for the US dollar to for emerging markets to only perform well if the US dollar weakens but it's certainly providing help. What is however more important and a real driver is innovation leadership in that combined with attractive valuations. So I have to say that you know we just return from extensive trips in Taiwan, Vietnam, South across Southeast Asia and we were deeply impressed again by the type of companies we are seeing my colleagues what he just came back from India again there the type of companies we are discovering they are highly innovative they are profitable they run by brilliant talents and those are the businesses we are really interested in and of course we are seeing that right now emerging markets continue to trade at very attractive valuations. Now just a few words on us we are now around for six years we've kept our S base quite stable over those six years highly differentiated returns we continue to focus on less covered names across emerging markets the portfolio continues to be concentrated less than 30 names we use our network and we have a very strict risk management with regards to both idiosyncratic risk but also macroeconomic risk which we are willing or unwilling to take into the portfolio. So 44.4% return since inception which is far better than the benchmark and makes us also look very good against competition. We've had tremendous issues and volatility this year as you know it's not a good year for us February, March where month where we are really challenged but we had those periods before in the past and we think we will come out of this and recover very strongly to make sure that also the short-term performance numbers move up again. In terms of our track record we've seen lots of lots of periods over the last decade of strong and weaker performance but it's always worth to stick to your guns and to focus on quality and focus on management teams and not create too much turnover in your portfolio to get through these periods just like this year. That has actually allowed us to generate over 10% outperformance against the MSCI emerging market mid-cap index and almost double the performance of the MSCI emerging market index since inception. You can obviously only generate this if you also invest very very differently so we have a very high active share. There's hardly any overlap between the strategy and the benchmark but that also explains especially when you look at sort of the more traditional sectors, banks, telecom, commodities, if there is a recovery rally in those segments we will in relative terms have difficulty beating at least the benchmark in this phase but we continue to believe that over the next 10, 15, 20 years you have to look at more innovative businesses than diversified wholesale banks and emerging markets but that's still 15, 70% of the benchmark. At the same time we've been very careful in China and we continue to be very careful and we do not compromise our focus on governance, transparency and minority shareholder protection. That is those are red lines for us where we don't make any compromise. Now if you look at MMIT against the peer group, the trusts listed on the London Stock Exchange over the last five years, my old shop is here as well, TEMH, APMOR and Fidelity, bearing so we've clearly outperformed them over the last five years and we are working very hard to ensure that we will be able to generate the same type of performance over the next five years. Now if you look at the broader, just broadly at sort of the playbook, the universe we're focusing on, I have to say 80% if not more of our time we focus on Asia. We spend a lot of time in Asia, we spend at least four months a year in India, we are blessed by having two very talented Indian partners in the firm who spent a lot of time there but also myself. We spend a lot of time in South Korea, Taiwan, recently Vietnam, Thailand and those are the, this is the hotspot for us. Turkey has been an interesting region for us since inception, we've lightened up our exposure quite significantly over the last couple of weeks as we see more opportunities elsewhere and we have actually increased our exposure to Brazil. In Brazil, we've had a couple of really good investments, we didn't get everything right but we got enough right to generate really good performance there. I think Brazil is one of those markets where you will see a very strong and positive development across different sectors because of strong macro, strong exports, the dividend they're generating from the commodity space and resources space in general. Of course, there's huge interlinkage between Brazil and the rest of the world, especially China but we've invested in more domestic place and again technology-oriented companies. Now, the universe itself is reduced from about 40,000 names to 8,000 names because of the focus on certain market cap, certain liquidity and we exclude also a lot of the industries which we simply don't have very high conviction in. It is manageable, the team is very busy focusing on generating new ideas. I guess the edge just in summary is the network, the fact that we focus really on a concentrated portfolio, our competitors have doubled if not tripled the number of stocks, we have a lot of co-investment in the fund, all of us are invested in the trust, that's all public and we don't compromise on the level of detail which we deploy when we build our research. The philosophy is really all about quality, it's all about uncovering modes, uncovering competitive strength, ideally businesses which have no competitors, I'll talk about some of them and at the same time focusing on brand leaders on investment teams and management teams which have a strong and positive reputation. Now, I mentioned briefly the on-the-ground research and then I'd like to spend more time on the portfolio but this just shows you here sort of our more recent travel schedule 24-25. We spent a lot of time in China, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, a lot of time in India, in South Korea and then again in Taiwan in the first quarter of this year which was very revealing and exciting to be there as well. A typical MMIT business will be a company that is first of all profitable, we don't invest in loss making businesses with strong margins which is highly competitive, a company that has sustainable competitive advantages against its sort of content within its context. I mentioned brand leaders, I mentioned innovation, so those are factors which are very important to us and we don't invest in industries which are sort of in decline. We also think that mid-cap stocks offer more potential and there are a couple of factors to take into account here. Number one, these companies are often not very well covered by the sell side, it is difficult to get information about them, you can't just download 10 broker reports and then feel comfortable. Many of them are not covered by any of the large budget houses so that is one opportunity angle in itself. At the same time, they increasingly have been able to compete for talent, a lot of the young talent in today's world prefer to work for smaller companies. We see phenomenal people here, phenomenal innovators in these smaller mid-cap businesses and of course they are also growing much faster. These are challenges, they are out there to compete hard, they are highly incentivized, many of the companies in our portfolio have very generous ESOP systems or incentivizing staff to work hard. Those are aspects we really like in this smaller mid-cap segment. We don't compromise on liquidity, many of these businesses, hundreds of these businesses across the different stock exchanges trade five, 10 million a day. This is the portfolio, these are the top 10 holdings which I briefly want to introduce. I'm going to talk about two companies in a bit more detail but as you can see most of these businesses are not really known by the wider investment community there and they are also not part of a larger MSCI benchmark maybe with one exception here. Park system is a great example in Korea, atomic force microscopy is really what they invented to a large degree. It's a technology which today is used for inspection and testing also in the semiconductor space. Earnings growth 25 is about 22% actually recently announced that they would beat this target and we are expecting 32% next year so they are rolling out their products and it's interesting to see that this atomic force microscopy is a new technology used in the semiconductor industry. So they created this industry and they created their own market. The addressable market is exploding. As semiconductors are becoming more complex, as the nodes are becoming smaller, also the testing industry is changing and evolving and they are sort of at the forefront. Maybe to mention another one here, 361, number three in India. This is a business which is aiming to revolutionize wealth management services in India. So they like to think of themselves as our Julius Bear. They want to be the Julius Bear of India. Difference is Switzerland is probably 10 million people and India is 1.4 billion and they are competing against Indian banks who are not independent. They're seen as not independent and 361 is one of the few independent wealth advisory firms. Very strong in alternatives. Recently announced a deeper collaboration with UBS. UBS took a 5% stake in the business and they're sharing certain assets and sharing certain access to services. So I would say interesting to observe what UBS is doing here in India. Another one which is exciting here and maybe briefly, I'll talk about this. We have a case study of this E-ink. Actually, let me talk about this in a slide later. Then we also have more classic businesses like an APL Apollo number seven, which again has been to some degree revolutionizing the construction industry in India as they were one of the first businesses in India to come out with ultra light steel parts for the construction industry which is used for infrastructure, public infrastructure, private infrastructure housing, train stations, logistics centers, which are all built with ultra light steel. There's a migration from more cement base to steel base construction, which is also more environmentally friendly and they have been growing market share very successfully in India. Again, a family-owned business, family-controlled business. The father is spearheading the operation. Two sons are in the business and of course the address of the market is phenomenal with India's multi-decade aim and ambition to build our better infrastructure. This is one company which is a relatively new addition to the portfolio. We are showing an excerpt here of the website which may look familiar to some of you. It's basically a classic automotive vertical like auto trader. You have those in every country. India is a very sort of nascent four-wheeler as they call it market. It used to be dominated more by the talk talks and two wheelers and now increasingly they're moving into a modern infrastructure and of course the car industry is all over it and a car trade is actually originally from an industrial family which is in car dealership in the car dealership industry and they have been now consolidating and establishing themselves as the leading platform. Interestingly, the founder of auto trader sits on the board so they work with internationally experienced partners. Founded only in 2009 they do have a multi-channel market a multi-channel marketplace in India. They are focusing on new end-use car sales processes and have gained market share quite successfully. It hasn't been listed for too long but the growth opportunity here is phenomenal. They also recently made a very smart acquisition and bought OLX which is another classified so they are really a leading classified operator with different verticals in India. Still fairly small, less than a billion market cap and we believe that this can become a multi-billion dollar business in India. Now I'm not suggesting you should eat classic salsa sauce. I'm not even allowed to buy manis at home or what I'm trying to show here is the price tax at the bottom and as you can see they are now also in dual color. They recently came out in multi-color which brings me to another company in the portfolio which is the world's only and leading thereby developer of electronic shelf ladles. You have them in the UK, you have them in China, you have them in the US. Walmart just rolled them out starting last year. Aldi in Germany has been rolling it out globally and they created this market. They created the technology in the industry. It's called E-ink and it's an essential part of the portfolio. Electronic display technology which started with Amazon Kindle. This was the first really breakout industrial breakout of this technology. There were lots of speculation about this technology being adopted also by the smartphone market. We haven't seen this yet in a large scale. They do exist but not large scale but that's another potential. Fast growing addressable marketing you can see it has different applications, e-readers, e-nodes, electronic shelf labels, laptops, phones, wearables but also we are now seeing the rollout of so-called large display technology within the retail, especially retail industries, larger retail shops but also in quick service restaurants such as Burger King etc. The indoor signals, indoor signs are made of this technology. The big advantage is it uses almost no power and it's very efficient to utilize. Again, this is an essential part of the portfolio, very successful business. Terrorists so far had a relatively limited impact especially on the portfolio. It had close to no impact as we are moving a lot into and always had a focus more on asset light businesses, more services and companies with deep molds and competitive advantages. So those are the ones which can pass on pricing, they can pass on higher cost, they can pass on or share tariffs to a large degree. So as you can see here across the portfolio especially the software part had of course very little exposure to tariffs. At the same time, if you look at the revenue exposure, domestic versus foreign, 93% domestic exposure is also another insurance policy baked into the portfolio so a lot less dependency on simply exporting to the United States. In terms of engagement, as you know for every business that we invest in, we try to actively engage and create sort of a conducive productive relationship between us and management team so that they can benefit from us sort of seeing things improving across the whole spectrum and enabling companies also to learn from developments in other markets. We are focusing on environmental aspects, social, especially governance, especially culture and capital allocation. That is part of our sort of day-to-day exchange with companies. We are in constant dialogue with portfolio companies. In terms of the outlook and we're coming towards the end of my prepared slides today, as I said at the beginning, the emerging market index has actually done extremely well over the last 20, 30 years. It had a decade of weakness against developed markets between 2010 and 2020 with the world index outperforming emerging markets significantly. Of course, I would say 85, 80, whatever plus 80% of this is magnificent in seven and the rest is if you take that out, it would look quite differently. If you would take China out, it would quite look quite differently. We believe that the current juncture is one where emerging markets can yet again enter into a prolonged phase of our performance. These are just averages. If you look at the evaluations, two very simple ways of looking at valuations, the S&P 500 is the dark blue. Look at the price to book ratio. It's now trading at a 25-year all-time high. If you look at earnings, it looks very similar, close to a 25-year all-time high, while emerging markets are trading at a dramatic all-time discount to those developed markets. Once institutions begin to shift, that gap can close relatively quickly. Ernie's growth, I did talk about this. India, of course, is leading here, Southeast Asia following closely after India in terms of producing this type of economic growth followed by China emerging markets in general and the developed market growth much below this. This again is well understood. We, of course, seeing that demand is driven by a large and growing consumer class across Asia. And the share of the middle class is growing very rapidly. Consumer spending and emerging economies is also growing very fast. China, of course, lagging at the moment. That's the biggest problem. But that's why we focus so much on India. And then lastly, innovation. And just to show you, it's not just words. There is hard evidence. In 1997, 6% of the benchmark was tech. It's now getting closer to 25%. And we think this can double. Whereas energy and utilities or industrial materials used to be dominant, which are now shrinking and important. So it makes sense to look at those businesses as we think that this journey, we're not even halfway there. In terms of the other risks, which often relate to buying expensive currencies, that's clearly not the case in emerging markets. Currencies across the entire universe in emerging markets are trading at attractive valuations compared to their own historical averages. So we are seeing we're buying into these opportunities without having to overpay for the currency. Now, this brings me to my last slide. And let me just go back to the very beginning. We're optimistic about earnings growth. We're optimistic about the broader economic conditions in emerging markets. We're seeing a lot of rational policymaking. We're seeing a lot less external risks. We're seeing that the demographics continue to be the driving falls between earnings growth. And the geopolitical shift is also interesting to observe. We'll see, I mean, Trump's days, I would say, are numbered. So there's going to, we have to look beyond this. And we think that the emerging market world, per se, is utilizing this now to its own benefit. So innovation, leadership, getting talent, attracting the right management teams, competing globally is what we're seeing. The pipeline is very strong. Our team is highly motivated. Despite the fact that this year was certainly painful, we have seen this as a positive challenge. And we strongly believe in our portfolio. And days like today, last couple of days, actually, we begin to see also that performance looks to be heading into the right direction. So let me close here and see if we can address your questions. That's great. Carlos, thank you very much for your presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, please do continue to meet your questions. And you can do so just by using the Q&A to have that situated on the top right corner of your screen. We have received a number of questions while you're presenting, Carlos. And we'll start with the first question here, which reads as follows. What emerging trends within your target markets you're most excited about from a long-term investment perspective? It's difficult sort of to narrow this into just one trend or two trends. But I would say that what we are observing in India, and especially when you approach the market with a long-term mindset, it's very easy to get discouraged about short-term valuations. It's easy to get discouraged by singular factors, which could lead to this year sort of being relatively muted here. But if you think about this, the government and the private sector have jointly embarked on a journey, which to some degree is comparable to what we've seen in China starting in the 90s. There is this combination of an industrial policy, improving infrastructure, government deregulation, massive reform, and highest-ever observed foreign direct investments into productive sectors, also export-oriented sectors. I would say that this is a market where yes, it's talked about a lot. Yes, it feels like every day there's a new India fund. But the good news is there are thousands of listed companies, and we are able to uncover businesses at a relatively early stage there. So I think this market is certainly one I'm very excited about. And it's also interesting to see, they're now talking about establishing ecosystems in other sectors, such as AI, semiconductors, technology in general, Apple has earmarked tens of billions of investments in India. So that is a process which will bring about new business opportunities and new investment opportunities far bigger than what we can imagine. Now, comparable to what happened when the founder, the actually US-based founder Morris Chang went to Taiwan and established TSMC. So I would say that's certainly one area which excites me a lot. Talking about Taiwan, I was probably called this out second. I'm not talking about Taiwanese politics, but I'm talking about I'm just focusing on the types of businesses we are encountering in Taiwan. And they are often, in most cases, global businesses. They're born in Taiwan, they may be listed in Taiwan or not, but they're now competing and producing globally. And again, here, this ecosystem, the combination of education and industrial policy, a highly capable private sector, very skillful managers are developing business ideas. And I think is a great example. Why does this? I mean, why is it in Taiwan? Why is TSMC in Taiwan? Why are all the IC design houses in Taiwan? It's because of this ecosystem. So that will be another one. Of course, I'm also excited about other markets. I continue to be excited about Brazil, but the types of opportunities are slightly different and not as scalable as what we are observing in Asia. That's great. Thank you, Carlos. We've got another question here. How are you positioning the portfolio in the light of ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, especially in sectors as opposed to tariffs of supply and chain disruptions? That's a very good question. And the answer is very sobering, or let's say the day-to-day experience is a very sobering one. So I think there are good companies in China. Whoever claims they're no good companies in China, I don't think is a very smart thing to say. So we've looked at various businesses. They are on our shortlist. They've been on our shortlist just as a sort of within the pool of ideas. Problem is for those companies, they may even have decent transparency in good governance, but they are then in sectors where there is a highly likelihood of the US or even Europe to limit the ability of this business to export the idea or to even go further and punish them by allowing them to access certain parts and technology and know-how and people. So we just stay away, to be honest. It's tempting and I see some competitors having done this and they jumped into it, but those are risks we rather avoid. You may look like a hero when you get this ride and you make a return with a weak business and a business which is fragile and in a fragile context, but we as a red line decided we don't want any exposure to this. We're focusing very much on companies which have close to no exposure or ability to deal with tariffs and certainly, as I said, number one, the rule is that we cannot afford to have a business which may go out of business because of those sanctions or tariffs. We have another question here from an investor. Over 30% of your portfolio is in China and Taiwan. The value of this may go to near to zero in the event of a conflict in that region. How do you be this risk? It's been discussed since October 2018 when we launched the strategy. I think the issue is that the value of many companies, including Apple, will go close to zero when there is some, let's say, if that case happens because every high performance chip is 85% of the global chips and every high performance chip is currently produced by TSMC in Taiwan. If there is an impairment to this business or any supply problems, you will see airlines, you will see public infrastructure, you will see the entire semiconductor dependent industries, automated factories, everything sort of going to zero if you follow that thesis. So that cannot be our base case and we continue to believe also China very much depends, of course, on a functioning relationship here. We've been trying to still keep our total exposure limited here. We have close to nothing in China directly. We've been limiting our overall exposure to Taiwan. Overall, we have a lot less here than benchmark, for example, and we have businesses which are largely producing globally or which are essentially producing no physical products. These are IC design houses. They don't produce anything apart from ideas. So that's also one way how we de-risk this slightly. But I want to be very clear if that's happening, not just us, but the whole world will be in deep turmoil. Understood, thanks for that, Carlos. We do have another question on a similar theme. I don't know if you have anything to add, but what contingency plans do you have if one of the core markets undergoes a regime change with Hewitt sanctions? So we have no investments in any single country where a regime change risk is anywhere close to possible. I mean, we have no investments in any of the more fragile frontier markets and have invested in stable countries where you have often many decades of democracy. Of course, we have to be careful. We have to be able to react. A regime change is a very dramatic word, even if there's a sudden deterioration in macro and politics, which can, of course, happen. We invest it in largely or entirely only liquid tradable investments, which we can sell very quickly. Russia is a good example. We did have two investments in Russia, and we sold about six months before the wall broke out. We have had, I mentioned this Turkey, which we sold basically. We used very significantly in one day with no problems. And therefore, yeah, this is, of course, one lever by not being exposed to illiquid businesses. And, you know, at the end of the day, emerging market investing means you take macro and geopolitical risk. Question is, do you get compensated for it? And so we analyze currency risk very carefully. We analyze geopolitical risk very carefully before we take any of these positions. And some of the most successful investments we've made over the last six years, one, or at least two of them, were actually in Taiwan, where we had like six, seven times a return on our initial investment. Similarly, even in Turkey, in US dollar terms, we made a positive return. So it's also about choosing the right type of business, of course. That's great. Thank you, Carlos. We've got a question here around the discount. With the trust trading at a persistent discount, what steps are you taking to create a catalyst for rewriting? So it's, I mean, we've got a fantastic board, which is analyzing the situation and is leaving sort of nothing to chance. We've considered buybacks, we're not convinced, it will reduce liquidity. Also in conversations with our investors, the feedback was throughout the last six years, grow the vehicle, stick to your guns, offer something different, and rather focus on growing the strategy rather than reducing it by buybacks. And buybacks are often just a very short term cure, which when you stop, as you can see with Tamit, Tamit is spending hundreds of millions of buybacks and the discount is still very sticky. It's more about delivering outsized investment returns. And yes, we had very, very good years, and we had since inception outstanding performance. But in a year like this year, not good enough, we have to do a better job. And we have to ensure that the strategy delivers even stronger performance that will ultimately be the most powerful factor to address the discount, because you create a market, you create appetite for your strategy. Of course, the other issue has been we've outperformed also that our discount is much smaller than that of competition. But the reason why a number of investors are still somewhat on the sideline and decided not to invest yet in our strategy is because it's too small and it's not liquid enough. So a bit of a chicken and egg issue, but all these strategies started somewhere. And this strategy has started in probably one of the most difficult periods emerging markets have experienced over the last 30 years. So we need to be also patient. We need to stick to our conviction. And we are very passionate about what we are offering. So I think there will be there's a good chance that over the next two or three years, the overall conditions for EM will help us as well and will help to generate more appetite for the trust. That's a great color. Thank you very much. We've got one final question here for you before I'll ask you just for a few closing comments and then we'll wrap the session up. The question is, if you're optimistic about earnings growth, is the fund geared at the moment? It's something we've considered just before COVID. COVID then made things very difficult. And it's something we are just working on right now. It's we came here. I think it's a very powerful and a useful mechanism, especially when you are at a period where you have such a tremendous opportunity lying ahead of you. It's just about negotiating the right terms and conditions. And that's what we have actually at the board. It's very much focusing on this as well. And that's what we are working on right now. So we have the redemption facility in November. We're very optimistic about sort of getting and seeing the right support from our investors and post this. We are very keen to explore the leverage of generality. So if there are no other questions. There are no further questions, Carlos and thank you very much for answering all of those. If I could just ask you for a few closing comments, that'd be great. And then we'll wrap things up. Well, I have to say I'd like to thank you for your interest today and for your support in case you are invested. I think again, I really would like to just make one final comment. Emerging markets have to be seen as a long-term opportunity. This was our message in October 2018. And if you just look back over the last seven years since we started, or six years since we started this strategy, it delivered what we expected. Outsized investment returns by investing very differently, by not compromising on quality, by navigating in this difficult environment, but by essentially the people I have to thank the most over this period of entrepreneurs we work with and whom we backed in the portfolio. So I think the chance today is even bigger than it was in 2018. The chance today for emerging markets to generate strong returns over the next five, six years are mainly driven by innovation, are driven by these type of business models, opening geographies for these markets, very strong Southeast Asia, these opportunities which cater to AI, which cater to factor automation, which cater to innovative telecommunication and general communication technologies, but also things in the more traditional sectors like automotive, autonomous driving, and the many different technologies needed to operate. These are now coming from emerging markets. So stay tuned. And if you do have other questions reach out to our team, and we look forward to servicing you over the next five years as well. Thank you. Well, that's great, Carlos. I'd just like to thank you once again for updating investors today. Could I please ask investors not to close the session as you now be automatically redirected to provide your feedback in order that the management team can better understand your views and expectations. But after management team with Mobius investment trust PLC, we'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation. And good afternoon to you all.
