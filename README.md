Thank you very much for attending the presentation of the summary of financial results for Q3 2025 and fiscal 2025 guidance by Bridgestone. Members to be introduced. Representative Executive Officer, Global CEO, Shu Ishibashi; Global CAO, Global CFO, Yasuhiro Morita; Global CFO, Global Financial Division Head, Naoki Hishinuma. So we have three presenters. I would like to, at this juncture, hand it over to Mr. Shu Ishibashi, who is the Global CEO and Representative Executive Officer, to give you the summary of financial results for Q3 2025 as well as fiscal 2025 guidance.
Good afternoon to everyone. I am Ishibashi, Global CEO. I will now explain our nine months results for Q3 and fiscal 2025 guidance. On a cumulative basis through Q3, adjusted operating profit increased YoY. Excluding foreign exchange effects, both revenue and profit increased. Net income decreased YoY due to the recognition of JPY76.6 billion in adjustment items, including the second stage of rebuilding expenses. The business environment remains challenging. Raw material impacts are trending towards the reduced profits. The impact of US tariffs, which is minor in the H1, has expanded since the beginning of the H2. We are countering these factors through a combination of various measures, including improving selling prices and product mix and continuing to strengthen our premium focus. Meanwhile, the US economic slowdown has become apparent, significantly impacting us through slower improvement in our US equity retail operations, a substantial decline in sales of truck and bus tires for new vehicles in North America, a resulting decrease in exports from Brazil to North America. Under these circumstances, we are further accelerating the activities promoted as part of our actions in “the era of emergency and crisis management.” Steady global business cost reduction activities have generated cumulative effects of approximately JPY52 billion compared to the previous year, strengthening the second stage of rebuilding measures, considering additional measures. Through these efforts, we believe we are achieving tangible results in reinforcing our business quality.Furthermore, starting in the H2 of this fiscal year, we are gradually initiating growth risk quality for replacement tires. Based on a premium focus, we are building and executing strategies across the BBGF, which stands for the best, better, good and fighting categories tailored to each such category. We are also intensifying efforts to revitalize Firestone tires in North America, our most critical market. In Q3, we expanded sales of aftermarket passenger car tires in key markets such as North American Firestone brand, Europe and Japan and also achieved expanded sales of truck and bus tires in North America and Japan. Furthermore, the volume increase effect and the resulting improvement in conversion costs generated an increase in profit of approximately JPY6 billion in Q3 alone, steadily contributing to growth. Furthermore, adjusted operating profit for commercial B2B solutions, which we position as a growth market, increased 144% YoY, driving growth with quality. We will now explain the details by area of management priority. North American operations recorded YoY profit growth. The premium tire business secured an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%. Notably, the truck and bus tire business has a solid foundation, achieving YoY sales growth in the aftermarket tire segment, particularly for the Firestone brand while also expanding sales and increasing market share in retread.We anticipate a significant improvement in profitability for the full year. In passenger car tires, the effects of rebuilding the US consumer tire business and the multi-brand strategy are becoming apparent, achieving increased sales and market share for the Firestone brand in the aftermarket. Concurrently, improvements were made in the US equity retail business through increased sales of major brands, continuous enhancement of customer satisfaction and the launch of new style retail outlets. This resulted in YoY profit growth and an adjusted operating margin exceeding 7%. We will continue these activities throughout the full year to further improve profitability. However, as explained earlier, the slowdown in the improvement of the retail business due to the economic downturn in the US and the negative impact on earnings from the decline in sales of truck and bus tires for new vehicles in North America. Furthermore, the cyber incident, which occurred in North America from August to September will also be a factor in the decline in earnings. In Latin America, we promoted business rebuilding and achieved YoY profit growth. We have renewed our management structure and are advancing operational improvements across the entire value chain from retail and sales to production at the actual sites or the Gembutsu Gemba. The rebuilding of the Brazilian business is also progressing as planned with profitability continuing to improve since Q1.However, the impact of reduced exports of truck and bus tires to North America due to the US economic slowdown has been significant. And unfortunately, achieving profitability in Q4 alone as we had aimed for now appears challenging. We will continue to improve operations under the new management structure, the one team. Our European operations, which faced many challenges are undergoing transformation of the shake and achieved YoY growth in both sales and profits. In the premium tire business, we secured an adjusted operating profit margin of 6% with both the truck and bus tire business in areas of rebuilding and retail business achieving YoY profit growth. In the truck and bus business, profitability was achieved across the entire portfolio, including new car tires, aftermarket tires and retreads. We will drive growth by introducing new products featuring ENLITEN and strengthening our fleet business. In the retail business, we will continue to improve operations at Gembutsu Gemba and expect to achieve profitability for the full year. For aftermarket passenger car tires, overall sales expanded significantly YoY by 105% with high rim diameter tires growing by 113%, leading to increased market share. We will continue to lead growth with quality in Europe. We believe that the European business will complete the business rebuilding in 2025 and the foundation for accelerating growth with quality from the H2 of 2026 is taking shape.The Asia Pacific, India and China business saw a year-on-year decline in profit, partly due to foreign exchange impacts. However, excluding the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, including those of local currencies, it achieved solid profit growth. Furthermore, the adjusted operating profit remained at around 11%, continuing to strengthen and improve business quality. By major region, the Indian consumer goods market, a growth market, continues to increase profits and gain market share. We are strengthening Dan-Totsu products, expanding the family channel and enhancing collaborations with strategic partners, and we will continue to pursue growth with quality going forward. In Thailand, where rebuilding is being promoted, the effects are being to show with increased sales and market share in consumer goods. In Asia, while the market environment currently faces intense competition from low-cost Chinese tires, we will further strengthen our foundation. This will be achieved by implementing the BBGF strategy, primarily in Thailand and Indonesia, where we historically maintain high market share and by enhancing our family channel. For the full fiscal year, we anticipate securing solid sales and performance at Bridgestone's second home market. The specialty tire and solutions business saw a decline in profit due to a time lag in the pricing scheme reflecting raw material prices and exchange rate indices, the rise and fall of those. However, it maintained a high profitable structure with an adjusted operating profit margin exceeding 20%.Furthermore, in mining and aircraft tires, positioned as growth markets, we are steadily expanding and strengthening our B2B solutions. For the full year, we expect to maintain a high profit structure with over 20% margins even with a significant profit decline and loss-making businesses in the agricultural tires. Next, I will explain to you the financial results by business portfolio. The premium tire business secured an adjusted operating profit margin of just under 14% despite challenging conditions. The solutions business, a growth business achieved a significant profit increase with adjusted operating profit up 155% YoY and a profit margin also growing by 2.7 percentage points over the previous year. With this segment, commercial B2B solutions achieved a profit margin exceeding 11%, representing a margin increase of over 3% points YoY. The retail business also saw a substantial increase in adjusted operating profit, reaching 163% of the previous year's level, achieving continuous improvement in profitability. On the other hand, the diversified products business faces deep challenges, and we will accelerate its rebuilding efforts. Finally, I will explain to you about our full year guidance. Taking into account changes since the H1 results announced in August, we have unfortunately revised adjusted operating profit downwards by JPY15 billion from the initial February guidance of JPY505 billion to JPY490 billion.Net profit of JPY253 billion and the dividend paid per share of JPY230 remains unchanged from the initial forecast. I will now explain the factors behind this downward revision. First, regarding the direct impact of US tariffs, the effect on adjusted operating profit remains unchanged from August at JPY25 billion. While the full impact will be felt in Q4, we are strengthening our business quality through intensified global cost reduction activities and implementing additional business rebuilding measures at the second stage of such. Furthermore, as previously explained, starting the H2, we are initiating growth with quality in consumer passenger and truck and bus tire business and commercial B2B solutions to improve profitability. Even in August, we anticipated deviations from the initial plan due to factors beyond tariff impacts such as deteriorating performance in our Latin American operations and diversified businesses. However, we expected to offset these through a combination of various measures, which are progressing as planned in the November forecast. Significant changes since August, however, have had major negative impacts on full year performance. These includes a substantial decline in sales of TB OE tires in North America due to the US economic slowdown, a corresponding decrease in exports from Brazil to North America and a slowdown in the significant improvement initially anticipated for the US equity business. Additionally, the impact of the cyber incident in North America, though solved by mid-September, also contributed to the profit decline.Due to these two changes of factors since August, we unfortunately decided to revise downward our adjusted operating profit by JPY15 billion. This is an overall revised 2025 guidance. Adjusted operating profit is JPY490 billion, securing YoY growth. Adjusted operating profit margin over 11%. ROIC around 9% level. ROE expected to be around 7% due to a negative impact from approximately JPY100 billion in adjustments, including rebuilding costs. Net income and dividends are expected to be in line with the initial guidance, and we will continue to strengthen shareholders' return. For fiscal 2025, we believe we have established a certain level of foundation for the growth with quality. However, regarding adjusted operating profit, unfortunately, it fell short of the guidance, resulting in the performance outlook that leaves challenges unresolved. Looking ahead to growth from fiscal 2026 onwards, we will thoroughly strengthen business quality, continue to solidify our foundation and lay the groundwork. For fiscal 2026 with a significant rejuvenation of the top management, we will shift to growth with quality as the final year of the 2024 MBP, continuing our evolution into a strong Bridgestone, winning in the turbulent business situation. We sincerely appreciate and ask for your continued understanding and support. Thank you very much for your attention.



OperatorThank you very much. That was Mr. Ishibashi on the summary of financial results through Q3 and fiscal 2025 guidance. To follow, I would like to call upon Global CFO and Executive Director, Global Finance, Naoki Hishinuma to present financial results for Q3 fiscal 2025.

NaokiBeing in charge of finance, I am Hishinuma. Here's my agenda today. Now I will begin by explaining the consolidated business and financial performance for Q3 of fiscal year 2025. These are the cumulative consolidated results through Q3 of fiscal 2025. Revenue, JPY3,234.9 billion, a one point decrease YoY. Adjusted operating profit was JPY368.4 billion, 4% increase. The adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, an improvement of 0.6 percentage points YoY. Excluding foreign exchange effects, we achieved both revenue growth and profit growth. Profit attributable to owners of the parent was JPY203.5 billion. While steadily advancing the second stage of rebuilding to reinforce business quality and recording approximately JPY77 billion in related expenses as adjustment items, net income decreased YoY due to factors, including the recording of approximately JPY63 billion in gains on sales of fixed assets in the prior year. We will explain the factors affecting the YoY change in adjusted operating profit. Cost increases due to rising raw material prices, primarily natural rubber and inflation, along with the impact of unrealized inventory gains included in others were offset by improvements in selling prices and product mix steady progress in business rebuilding to improve business quality and the effects of global business cost reductions. This resulted in a YoY increase in profit. Furthermore, in Q3, sales volume also increased and conversion costs improved in line with the volume increase. We are gradually starting to see growth with quality, starting with replacement tires.Performance by segment. In the Japan segment, domestic replacement tire sales exceeded the prior year, leading to increased revenue. However, due to factors such as the timing difference in the exchange rate and raw material index-linked price adjustments in the mining tire business, profit decreased YoY. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, the segment achieved both increased revenue and profit. In Asia Pacific, India and China, rigorous lean expense management and rebuilding initiatives drove profitability improvements. Excluding currency effects within the region, profits increased YoY. In the Americas, the truck and bus tire business and the retail business in North America contributed to increased profits and improved profitability. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, expanded sales of passenger replacement tires, particularly high rim diameter tires contributed to increased profits and improved profitability. In both regions, business cost reductions and reinforced business quality through rebuilding initiatives supported performance. Now I will explain the performance by product category. For passenger car and light truck tires, particularly improved YoY through continued expansion of premium tires such as high room diameter tires and improvement in the product mix. For truck and bus tires, sales of aftermarket tires in North America remained strong and the effects of business rebuilding gradually materialized, leading to increased profits compared to the prior year and the significant improvements in profitability YoY.Specialty tires saw steady sales of mining tires and expanded B2B solutions. However, due to the timing effect of exchange rate and raw material index-linked price adjustments as well as reduced profits in the agricultural machinery tire business, profits decreased YoY. Nevertheless, profitability remained high at 20.6 percentage points, maintaining a high profit structure. The diversified product business segment will be explained on the following page. The Diversified Products business achieved YoY profit growth through fixed cost reductions and asset streamlining. However, the challenging business environment persists due to continued weak demand for construction and agricultural machinery. The sports and cycle business recorded a cumulative loss. However, within the cycle business segment, we are working to improve performance by expanding sales and reducing fixed costs, resulting in the narrowing of the losses. The Americas diversified products business continues to face a challenge in business environment, but improved profitability in the new vehicle business led to increased profits compared to the prior year and improved profit margins. Next is adjustment items. For the cumulative Q3, rebuilding-related expenses totaled JPY76.6 billion with the main breakdown as shown. Continuing from the H1, we recorded business rebuilding-related expenses, primarily in North America, Latin America and Europe. Financial statements and cash flow status. The total asset decreased to JPY5,488.5 billion compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, partly due to the impact of yen appreciation.The cash and cash equivalent ratio relative to monthly sales decreased by 0.4 months compared to the end of the previous fiscal year. We are promoting lean management towards our target of 1.5 months of monthly sales. For finished products, we continue to rigorously implement lean inventory management, resulting in a decrease compared to the same period last year, excluding the impact of the exchange rate. Free cash flow resulted in the inflow of JPY243.7 billion while steadily executing growth investment, we improved operating cash flow through enhanced working capital management, achieving JPY97.8 billion increase in cash flow compared to the previous year. Regarding the capital policy announced in February, we are steadily advancing share buybacks and releveraging debts. For share buybacks, process stands at approximately 86% as of the end of October, proceeding according to the plan. Next, I will explain fiscal 2025 guidance. As explained earlier, we revised our consolidated earnings guidance for the full fiscal 2025, as shown on the slide. We expect revenue to increase by 1% compared to the February guidance, reaching JPY4.36 trillion. Unfortunately, we anticipate adjusted operating profit to be lower than planned at JPY490 billion, though we plan to secure a YoY increase. Net income remains unchanged from the guidance at JPY253 billion. The dividend per share also remained unchanged from the previous forecast of JPY230 for the full year.I will now explain the factor affecting the revision in adjusted operating profit. The impact of rising raw material prices was offset by selling prices and product mix. Regarding tariff impacts, we were countering them with various measures. We expect to achieve YoY profit growth by realizing growth with quality, strengthening business rebuilding efforts and generating effects from steady global business cost reductions. Now for the segments as revised for 2025 guidance. In the Americas segment, although profit forecast has been lowered from the February guidance due to the apparent slowdown in the US economy and the impact of cyber incidents, we continue to plan for YoY profit growth. In Europe, profit forecasts have been raised from the February guidance, driven by increased sales of premium tires, particularly HLD tires and steady progress in business rebuilding. Finally, we will explain the stock split. At the Board of Directors meeting today, we resolved to implement a two-for-one stock split. This aims to create a more accessible investment environment for investors and encouraging the expansion of the investor base. The record date is December 31, 2025, and effective date will be January 1, 2026. Please note that the year-end dividend forecast remains unchanged at JPY150 per share as it is based on the number of shares prior to the split. This concludes my explanation. Thank you very much for your attention.
OperatorThank you very much. So that was Mr. Hishinuma on financial results for Q3 of fiscal 2025. Moving on to questions and answers. From Jiji Press, Yasuda-san, please.
YasudaThank you. So the actual performance of the full year guidance, you referred to the slowdown of the North American macro economy with a substantial impact. Background factors as well as the prospect going forward, I would like to get your views further.
IshibashiThank you. First of all, in our retail operations, it's affected by consumer confidence. So this is a leading factor, which seems to be aggravating faster than others. So the consumer trend are getting more and more reserved. So that, of course, is linked to the selling prices as well. But anyway, it's getting weaker. So retail operations that we have in the US, customer satisfaction survey and all that points to the improvement of the confidence and mood. And we started the fiscal year with a higher level of target. In comparison with that, deceleration of the market and the economy is such that the improvement, yes, but not as much as we had aimed for in the beginning of the fiscal year. As regards to the truck and bus tire business, the OEM and the truck assemblers, there are quite a few of them in the US. As you are aware, their respective performances, they have been trending down.And that's happening sharply and quite rapidly. Since August, the total number of trucks assembled started to decrease. And our share actually has been rising. However, the total market variable of the truck market because of the decreased assemblies is affecting us negatively. But because of the rising trend of our own market share in that particular market segment, we have not been heard any more than what we reported to you. So the leading index that we have in that regard and not to mention the US-China bilateral relations, we cannot take our eyes off of that. The situation remains to be quite volatile. So into next year, truck assemblers, the overall trends will continue to be severe. However, the consumer trend as we expect into next year, would be possibly changed for the better because of various government initiatives. That's it.
OperatorThank you, Mr. Yasuda for that question. From Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Mr. Takahashi, please.
I am Takahashi of Nihon Keizai Shimbun. I would like to ask you about the currency or the exchange rate. This time, you had given JPY148 or JPY147 as a forecast. I think JPY145 or JPY150 for were what you had, but you had actually revised this and the impact on your performance as a result. And under the [inaudible] administration, I think there is a further advance of the depreciation of yen. What is your forecast?
NishinumaThe impact of the exchange rate is that weakening of yen does actually work as a positive factor for our results, maybe about JPY2 billion or JPY900 million for Europe. So these are the impact from the exchange rates. As we move towards the end of the term, we are reviewing this and the impact towards the end of the year is if there is more of the depreciation of the yen, there could be some negative impact. But basically, those are the impact that we see from the exchange rate. As for the exchange rate forecast for next year and so on, the basic trend is that reflecting the difference in the interest rate, I believe that it will probably proceed as is, but the present level of the depreciation of yen, and I think maybe there will be a further advance in the weakening of the yen as compared to what we had anticipated. But I think we are now discussing as to how we could project this, but those are under discussion at present right now. Would this respond to your question?
Thank you. Mr. Takahashi. From Diamond, Yamamoto-san, please.
Yamamoto from Diamond Magazine speaking. Thank you. I have a question for Mr. Morita, Global CSO. Starting in the H2 of FY2025, growth risk quality has been upheld. But at the same time, JPY15 billion downward adjustment in the adjusted operating profit. So we understand because of the deterioration of North America macro economy, there are reasons for that. But what is your prospect for economy going forward after you're going to be succeeding Mr. Ishibashi as the next global CEO?
Thank you for your question. JPY15 billion downward adjustment, yes. In the final quarter, we were expecting the very dynamic recovery. However, it's not as though that actually is going to happen. So that's the major factor in the background, meaning that it's not as though in respect in contrast with the first nine months period, the remaining three months period will get weaker. That is not the change that is there. However, it's just that the performance recovery that we had contemplated in the final quarter alone would not happen. Now as to gross risk quality, it's not just the pursuit of the volume just for the sake of volume enhancement. But the quality, the growth with quality is very important so that we will be better, even more appreciated by those customers who will purchase our tires. So quality aspect is very important. So mindful of the downward adjustment, yes, still, we do consider that we will continue to have just the same strong force of growth. Particularly, North American after the market, not to mention the truck and bus market, Q3 results were quite good. And we continue to carry forward with the same momentum to the end of the fiscal year, which will go into the next fiscal year as well.
Hata of Toyo Keizai, can you hear me? Thank you for this opportunity. For 2026, your forecast, I believe that there are quite a bit of rebuilding in place. And what would be some of the impact from the US slowdown, et cetera, to your plan? I believe that you are able to expand your profit, but what is the most recent forecast?
IshibashiAs for the guidance for the 2026, we are now having a discussion -- and this will be the last year of the MBP 2024. So we will be moving towards the target for this 2024 MBP. And we are now trying to see what kind of impact there. When we had formulated 2024 MBP, we did not anticipate the Trump tariffs or the major transformation in Latin America. Therefore, while we counter those difficulties, we hope to be able to overcome them. And as in the H2 of this year, we would like to implement growth with quality, especially for the replacement tires for the passenger and truck tires. We are seeing some new developments, and we hope to be able to come close to what we had anticipated and forecasted, and we'll make efforts. In February next year, Mr. Morita will provide you with the performance results and also the prospect for next year. So please wait until then. Thank you very much.
OperatorThank you, Mr. Hata. From here on, we would like to move on to the questions from the analysts. We have already chosen the people to ask questions. In lieu of time, I’d like to ask you to only ask one question per person. First, from BofA Securities, Mr. Sakamaki.
SakamakiThank you. I am Sakamaki. Can you hear me? Thank you. I would like to ask this one question. Well, for Q3, what do you think was your actual operating profit as compared to what you had looked at? And for Q4, when you look at the variations, the operating cost seems to be a major impact factor. There may be some buffer there, although you are not concerned that much, but I think you had declined a little bit or I can revise it downwards a little bit. But maybe when it comes to the end, it may not have been as bad. Mr. Ishibashi mentioned the aim to fulfill the target for the MPP. What kind of result can we expect? I think that prices are being reflected well and are going as planned. So are you just being conservative in sort of lowering your figures? Or what is your anticipation? Does it really have an impact for the next quarter as well?
IshibashiThe results for Q3 we felt that there would be a lot of different tariffs, and we wanted to counter those tariffs. And while doing that within our organization, I believe that there was a positive result. And I think we did well under those situations. However, as mentioned here, there are a lot of headwinds. And in Q4, as we move towards Q4 or actually, we are already feeling it from Q3, I think those headwinds will be stronger. OE tire situation for the truck and buses in the retail business, the number of decline in the customer count are already being seen. And for the cyber incident, there is an increase significantly of the back orders. And the reason for that is the production had stopped. And although the retail or the sales continued, production had to be suspended. Therefore, there is increase in the back order, and there is a loss on the part of the business, which actually happened. And right now, we have not been able to fulfill or cover all the back orders. As we move towards Q4, this will continue. Therefore, it's not that we have a good buffer and anticipating this lower number.JPY505 billion is something that we are really looking at. Therefore, we really wanted to achieve this. So therefore, we are very unhappy about this. So including the passenger and for the TV, there are many, many good things that are happening. There are growth and the retails are being improving. And for the passenger and TV replacement, we are seeing improvement. So there are many, many improvements seen, but Latin America or diversified products and the impact of the cyber incident and the truck and bus OE in North America, they are actually sort of dragging us down. And we are calmly trying to evaluate this situation. And I think we need to be accountable. And as a result, we had come up with the numbers that you see here. We still have 1.5 months and for the tires, snow tires, maybe in Japan and in European countries, we hope to be able to do much better and people are actually working hard towards that end. And maybe HRD in Europe will do a better job. So we are making efforts continuously to be closer to the JPY505 billion.But for the time being, maybe JPY490 billion is something that we can be committing ourselves to as we become accountable. And based on this, we will formulate our budget. And next year is the last year of the 2024 MBP. There are various targets that we had set. And as mentioned at the very beginning, there is an impact of the tariffs by Trump and also the impact of Latin America situation, which were not actually incorporated in the 2024 MBP. But we do have various very positive activities, initiatives that many people are making efforts on, and we hope to be able to pursue them so that we can create a budget that will sort of match or become as close to as possible with what we had anticipated and much effort is being made. We will decide on the next year's budget in December, and Mr. Morita will announce them in February along with all the plans, solid plans that we have, and I hope you will be able to wait for the announcement then. Thank you.
OperatorThank you, Mr. Sakamaki. Moving on, I would like to call upon Mr. Yoshida from Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. Over to you. Excuse me, could you repeat from the top? Very sorry, we could not catch the top of your question. Excuse me.
YoshidaFor the North American segment, Q3 profits were good. So would you analyze that? I'm sure you already covered the positive and negative factors. So would you like to sort them all out once again? And as to the final quarter, in contrast, it seems that you are thinking that it is going to decline either YoY or the QoQ. So what about the sustainability of this momentum in North America? I ask this because there are both the pluses and minuses. Would you sort out what's really going on in North America?
HishinumaOkay. Q3, three months basis, what has changed YoY? JPY23 billion increase in profits YoY, big factors. Selling prices and product mix improved, volume and expense control as well. So these are all on the YoY basis, the positive factors, which led to the strong performance in Q3. In contrast, for the final quarter, outlook is that and YoY negative is the cost that we project, big factors once again. First of all, it has to do with the expense situations. What I'm trying to say is that on the full year basis, the expense situation will turn out to be better YoY. However, for the three months, the final quarter alone because of the timing of the stagger, it is going to be a negative factor. And also the tariffs, negative impact will be bigger in the final quarter in Q4 than what it was in Q3. But basically, the negatives can be counted back is the overall situation. I hope I answered it adequately.
YoshidaYes, you did. So that means that the way you start the next fiscal year would be that the level of the final quarter, the tariff impact.
NaokiSo I suppose that, that is the level of the platform that you will start from for the next fiscal year. Your tariff factor and the business plans are being worked on. However, whatever happens in the current fiscal year will be countered back, meaning that simply put, it's the expense control where because of the timing factor, we will not be able to control the tariff matter in the final quarter. I think there is a page describing tariff situations in your presentation deck. Straight forward impact, JPY500 million in the H1, JPY7 billion going to JPY17.5 billion order in the final quarter. So as you can see, it's Q4, there are the various other factors there that JPY175 billion, the number that we have to keep in mind is important. In order to mitigate those impacts, we are thinking about the further refinement of the sourcing plans. But setting aside the sourcing plans that we execute, if at the same currency, the final quarter direct impact will be expected to affect us as we move into the next fiscal year, be it the sourcing plans next year and other plans as well, how we can collectively counter back the negative thrust blowing towards us. I hope that makes sense.
Thank you. I am Kakiuchi of Morgan Stanley. In North America, I would like to ask you about the price situation for TBR and for passenger, what the US situation is? And what is the overall situation for your industry? And also the production locally in your case may be serving as a positive factor. And what is the price increase for the imported tires? What is the general trend? And what is your position vis-a-vis the overall market situation?
IshibashiAs for the United States or North America, there are various litigations going on at present regarding price. For various price we have been asked not to make any public comments or comments in public. Therefore, I am not able to comment on that. But when we look at the market situation objectively, there is a major brand and the other brands levels. But in some area, there is price increases, and that is true. In imported products, there are increasing prices. And for the major brands, there are a certain amount of price increases. But unfortunately, I am not able to comment anything more specific or concrete regarding this matter.
ShinjiThank you very much. Regarding passenger and TBR, if you separate them, what do you think is the competitive situation for yourself, which is even more competitive?
IshiAt present, we have Firestone brand, and I have actually disclosed some information in Q3. In the Q1, Q2 and Q3, we have been able to increase the rate. Firestone revitalization, I think information sheet will be able to show you that. Here, you will see that this is for the passenger tires. You see that even there for the high rim diameter, it was 95, 105 and 107 as we go towards the quarters. And as a result of that, there is an increase here, growth here. When you look at your competitors, the tires with the same level of Firestones are having difficulties. We have the Bridgestone as well as Firestone tire value, and we have been able to indicate the value and show the indicate of the tires that we have. For TB, Firestone brand is growing. It may not be as much as 113, but for the Firestone for the TB, it is growing. So we can effectively utilize the Firestone brands, and we can actually appeal the value. And I think we have been able to do well in order to meet the demand of the market. Does this answer your question?
As we move towards the next year, I guess that Firestone brand will have a good impact in terms of volume. The increase in the volume in Q3 will have good impact on the productivity improvements in Q3. And the fact that there is an increase in Q3 is extremely welcoming factor for us. There is cost, price and the volume balance that we are looking into. And if this works out well, I think we can move on to the next stage. Does this answer your question?
Thank you very much, Mr. Takeuchi. It's approaching the scheduled closing time. So the next is going to be the final question. Mr. Sakaguchi from Mizuho Securities, please.
Sakaguchi from Mizuho Securities. Thank you. Adjusted operating profit, JPY15 billion worth of downward adjustments, the revision and you identified three factors at play. Would you be able to quantify the magnitude for the three each? And at the same time, North American truck and bus OE business and the retail equity operations, you talked about the worsening of the overall macroeconomic conditions, the requirements to embark on additional measures. And that is the cost that you contemplate, but that would be accompanied by the cost to be incurred.
IshibashiFirst of all, the JPY15 billion, the three factors at play. cyber incident, the insurance matters due to various constraints, I cannot disclose some of the factors. However, of the three, the biggest is the retail equity retail operations because we had looked for substantial improvements of the situations. The results are better than what it was last year. Yes. However, it was not as much as we had anticipated. So of the JPY15 billion downward adjustments, I'd say that about one half of that comes from not as robust improvements in the retail operations. And the other two, the truck and bus, the operations and cyber incident. Speaking of truck and bus, the market, demand YoY is less by 20%, 30%. So there's a sizable impact throughout the industry. And as I said earlier, we do have the increasing the share among the truck companies and truck manufacturers, assemblers. So our impact is less than what others are feeling in the industry at large. Next year, obviously, we will definitely defend and preserve our share in that particular segment of the market, meaning that our position will continue to be strong, meaning that our stance is not going to be eroding.We will continue to support flexibly how the truck assemblies operate next year. In the aftermarket, we are generating profits. So that being the recovered, the improved situation, although it's been more harsh in the past couple of years, the trucking business is quite strong for us in the North America national fleet, retread and key brands. We do have the suite of Dan-Totsu strong products. So in sync with the macroeconomic trend, we will focus on the magnitude of recovery that our major customers will be able to accomplish in line with the movement of macro economy. Now, the US [inaudible]. In the LA area, the volume which is transported, the cross country in North America is getting smaller. So we have to watch for that. And Firestone brand increasing in volume that's selling through dealership. So mid- to smaller fleet companies, how they will operate into next year. And also, obviously, they recognize the value of the Firestone brand, which is good.That's the reason why we have been able to further improve our share position. And therefore, in sync with the national fleet, the relationships with smaller fleet operators, those who are operating in the local supermarkets, it's very important. If the US macro economy continues to be strong and improve, then not only national fleet, but also the smaller fleet will have the recovered positions. And the sensitivity will be quite strong, particularly for those fleets. And at the same time, 220, the equity stores that we have catering to the needs of North American customers, the indices and the conditions will be followed quite closely. Basically, our action will stay the same so that as macroeconomic conditions improve, then there will be an opportunity for us to turn to more aggressive stance. As to the cyber incident, there was a one-off factor. Next year, we certainly assume that that's not going to be repeated. So for the first two factors, our view is, as I described.
Thank you very much. Accepted. So it's not as though you're going to incur any further expenses. But rather with the continuation of the same initiatives, you will be able to capture the opportunity to maximize your gains.
Right. Truck and bus tires, we have already closed down the [inaudible] plant, which used to produce truck and bus tires. So from a standpoint of total optimization, how we can continue to produce the high end the products with the controllable adequate costs. And in doing that, we will be able to better take advantage of our strong position in the market.
Thank you very much indeed. One more for you, Mr. Ishibashi, in this in hospitable external conditions, I am sure that you would continue to do your utmost until the very final day, and thank you very much for the long-lasting relationship.
