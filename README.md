And now I would like to turn the call over to Stephen salts Stephen. Yeah, thank you John and thank you everyone for joining us today. We're pleased to have posted the strongest net revenue margin in company history at 62.5% which supported 22% year over year growth in that revenue the quarter and 3% sequential growth. We also included news in the earnings release about how rivalry token is already driving results, including 1.7 million in revenue generated subsequent to the end of Q two. And we expect this to remain a revenue stream for the business throughout the rest of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. This is an important development that I will come back to later. As we've made margin growth an area of focus over the past several quarters. We are happy to see it deliver. However, to some extent, this involves a trade off with handle growth, which did see declines year over year. But we believe long term we are taking the right steps and this supports our path to profitability in the immediate term. We first identified margin as a priority one year ago on our Q two 2023 investor call. We recognize that why was large and was below the industry average and that this would hamper efforts to achieve profitability. In response, we made adjustments to our offering and launched new higher margin products like same game called both the pre made parlays, which have become increasingly popular with our players. Since it's released in January, 2024, we've accepted over 500,000 pre made parlay bets improving sports, but cold and driving that revenue. The impact can be seen in our financial results, where we have now set new all time highs for net revenue margin in two consecutive quarters. Our margin for the first half of 2024 at 60 and a half percent is a full 15% above the full year, 2023 margin of 45 and a half percent. And we believe there's more upside to go. I mentioned that the pursuit of a higher margin effects handle parlies are high entertainment value products, but on average players end up with a bit less of their wallet available to place and expect. It's also winning a parlay on lower than single bets. However, the potential winning payout for the parlay is much larger. So on average, our margin goes up, but aggregate handle can be negatively impacted. We accept that trade off and we'll continue to ride that line of driving margin while engaging and supporting player retention for continued play. As mentioned, our earnings release this morning, we are narrowing our focus on two key areas that we believe are showing the highest potential for growth in our history. The first is channeling resources to acquire, engage, and retain VIP players. And the second is expanding into the crypto segment through rivalry token and incorporating Web3 technology across our product suite. We've made a substantial amount of progress on these initiatives over the past two quarters with an exciting roadmap ahead that I'm keen to share. Before I speak to these two core initiatives further and how we expect them to strengthen our business, I want to state that we acknowledge recent share price performance is not where our investors nor our team wants it to be. With respect to that, I'd like to detail what we believe our business has delivered exceedingly well up until now. What is and isn't advancing our business objectives to the next phase of growth and how we're moving forward to deliver that. Since we founded the company, Rogler's Vision has been ever made to create the de facto online betting product brand and experience for digitally native consumers. As we've communicated many times, this is a demographic reshaping of consumers interact with technology products and media. And it's impossible to overstate the difference in behavior, consumption, and entertainment preferences between a generation that grew up on the internet and prior ones. Finding success among the unique and tailored strategy that Broadway has been trailblazing, we believe there's uncapped upside in delivering this experience to the user correctly. In hindsight, however, we made some strategic missteps along the way relative to supporting VIP or high value players. We over-indexed on creating value for the high volume of players who would be considered low value by industry standards, meaning they do not place a high dollar value of bets. In online gambling, the ratio is typically 10 to 20% of players will drive 80 to 90% of revenue. This is not unlike other consumer sectors, such as mobile games, or even products like Language Learning App, Duolingo, who recently noted that about 10% of its users drive more than 80% of their revenue. Up until recently at rivalry, however, we spent a great deal of effort delivering a world-class experience to the inverse, the 80 to 90% of players who deliver a smaller percentage of the revenue. And this was core to our thesis on the space and where we believed we could create outsides value. And we did. However, in hindsight, this is a long-gated our path to reaching critical mass and therefore, profitability as the relative scale required to hit that tipping point is much higher. So this led in framework around focusing on this segment of our player population permeated how we built an online gambling product. Additionally, in an effort to establish customer trust and transparency, we were overly conservative on player management and risk profiles. We've adjusted the risk profile while maintaining compliance, but it now puts us in a far more competitive position, reducing friction for users on boarding into rivalry and creating a better experience for the ITs, which we are now relentlessly focused on serving with the same obsessive dedication to their success as we had beat up until now on the other side of the player base. That said, it's not all for not. And all of these decisions still built a very positive experience for the vast majority of our player base. This is driven out performance compared to our peers and engagement, retention rates, and cost to customer acquisition. And I'm certain these features will create value for VIP players as we rapidly backfill the other missing pieces of enabling their experience. Despite the need to push along this course correction, we have still managed to increase our net revenue more than 7x and our underlying margin by 50% since our IPO in 2021. Over multiple quarters, we've shown a consistent stabilization in our operating expenses and continued to cut spend while driving that revenue growth and hitting record customer KPIs. Internally, we have maintained and strengthened our operational excellence performance culture output and ability to drive outcomes, allowing us to see new opportunities and iterate quickly. Beyond VIP, we are also demonstrating this today through a rapid expansion into crypto, which is yielding very motivating early results. I have extreme conviction in the direction we are headed and the team responsible for getting us the next stage of growth. Before I go any further, I'm going to ask Demi Abudigod Benson to review our Q2 2024 financial results in greater detail. As I'm sure everyone saw, Demi was recently appointed interim CFO at rivalry, and I'd like to welcome her to her first inaugural quarterly investor call. Demi is the financial leader with over a decade of experience in corporate reporting, auditing, and strategic planning. Prior to joining rivalry in February of 2022, Demi was the director of finance at Swash Digital and spent more than 10 years with Deloitte, Canada, working across the UK, Southeast Europe, and Canada. Now, Demi, over to you. Thank you, Stephen. Betting Handel was 87.8 million in the second quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 22% from 112.2 million in quarter to 2023. As Stephen described in his remarks, our emphasis on margin improvement has had an impact on overall betting activity. However, we believe our growth initiatives will begin to offset this without an increase in overall expenditure. Gross gaming revenue of 7.4 million declined year-over-year by 12%. The rate of D3s was less pronounced than Handel, consistent with our trend of holding an increasing amount of GGR as a percentage of Handel. Despite Handel pressure, net revenue of 4.7 million was up by 0.8 million or 22% from quarter to 2023. As a percentage of DGR, our net revenue margin was 62.5%, a record resolved for rivalry, eclipsing the previous record of 58.5% established just last quarter. For comparison, our margin was approximately 45 to 46% throughout 2023. Stephen described some of the factors contributing to margin improvement, led by the popularity of a number of IR margin products introduced in the past several quarters. Looking at the two sentiments, gaming generated 60% of Handel with Sportsbook accounting for 40%. This split is consistent with what we have seen over the past several quarters and compares to a 50-50 split a year ago. The Sportsbook segment generated a larger share of gross gaming revenue, accounting for approximately three quarters of GGR. The gaming segment at one quarter of GGR was at the high end of its historical range. I will now turn to operating expenses. Total operating expenses decreased by 0.5 million or 5% compared to quarter to of 2023. Marketing, advertising and promotion expenses was the only operating expense item to increase year over year, up modestly by 12%. This was more than offset by decreases in the other two major items, with general and administration down 8% and technology and content down 31% compared to quarter to of last year. And I would like to note that in the third quarter, the company has continued to make select cuts to its marketing expenses and rationalised teams where possible as part of narrowing our focus around VIP and rivalry token initiatives. The combination of higher net revenue and lower operating expenses led to a 1.3 million year over year improvement in loss from operations, which was our narrowest of the past five quarters of 4.8 million. Net loss of 5.8 million represented a smaller improvement of 0.9 million from quarter to of 2023. This quarter we recognise 0.5 million of interest expense on the convertible debenture, which was not applicable a year ago. This is a non-cash expense as interest will be approved until the end of 2025. Lastly, I will briefly touch on our financial resources. We ended quarter to 2024 with 4.6 million of cash subsequent to quarter end rivalry token as generated 1.7 million in additional revenue. And we anticipate this to continue to be a revenue stream throughout the rest of quarter 3 and into quarter 4. With our current cash position, new revenue streams, tie-working capital management and cost-structural adjustments that we have initiated in the third quarter as noted earlier, we remain confident in our liquidity position. I will now turn the fourth back to Sweden. Thank you, Demi. We are deeply focused on advancing the priorities I've outlined earlier. One, developing our VIP customer base and two, expanding into the crypto segment. Starting with the latter, we believe our movement to incorporate Web3 technology and extend our brand into the crypto market will be one of the more significant catalysts in our history. Industry estimates suggest that crypto gambling accounts for up to one quarter of betting handle globally now. The figures point to grow at digital natives age further into the industry's Goldilocks zone and seek out crypto compatibility in their products. The world of crypto overlaps neatly with our existing user base, deepening our already strong product market fit among digitally native users while unlocking a new audience of betters that is more engaged with higher revenue potential, aligning closely with our VIP strategy. In addition to releasing a more fulsome crypto wallet and payment experience last quarter, we also announced Rivalry token. Rivalry token will be our native cryptocurrency integrated across our platform to elevate the user experience from retention to loyalty and engagement with plans to launch the product later this year subject to market and product related considerations. While Rivalry token hasn't fully launched yet, customers have been able to engage with it by connecting their digital wallets earning rewards through site activity. And most recently, a new web based product we deployed in August since that users have been able to opt in to receive nuts, which will later convert into rivalry token for their sports wagers casino activity and other actions to be performed on the site. The first phase of this project has marked the most successful reactivation campaign in rivalries history. More than half of the opted in customers return users while another 15% were new. In roughly 90 days, rivalry token is attracted to geographic and diverse audiences twice as valuable as their average user in terms of revenue potential and lifetime deposits. Often in users are exhibiting more activity and engaged behavior their average customer playing all days of the week and spending two thirds of betting handle on casino. These upward trends in revenue and player engagement are by design and closely connected to the utility and value created for users through the token. Subsequent to quarter end, rivalry token drove 1.7 million in revenue validating our crypto strategy and product potential. This is expected to remain a revenue stream for the business throughout the remainder of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. We have an extensive roadmap ahead for rivalry token intended to build at our early momentum. Soon we'll be releasing new social based products and games to drive connected wallets, acquire users, and capture market share in the crypto gambling segment. Later in the year, again subject to market conditions and product considerations, rivalry token is expected to launch, which is called the token generation event or TGE. We're opted in players will claim token to be deposited directly into their crypto walls, but they can then use to interact with the site and are offering for the variety of ways we will detail in the coming months. As seen in the early KPIs from rivalry token, our crypto strategy supports our focus on high value players, but it will not end there. We recently kicked off a large and highly focused effort across multiple departments to better acquire, engage, and retain VIP players on our platform. On the product side, we're working hard to rapidly enhance our payment speed limits and overall experience, and we will also be adding greater depth to our sports book and casino content. We've already optimized our onboarding experience to streamline and reduce unnecessary friction for users that want to play out rivalry. It will be shifting our attention to the rest of the customer journey. This includes the development of high value player loyalty programs tailored CRM efforts, onboarding additional VIP managers as needed, and adjusting our marketing funnel to optimize for high potential LTV players that we've built a robust business intelligence engine and tools to detect early in their journey. The efforts that just noted are only the high level buckets, but within stand out into various other efforts that are underway. We have delivered well above market success on the 80 to 90 percent of players that in an online gambling business typically drives 10 to 20 percent of the revenue. We're now going to be employing that same deliberate and thoughtful effort to the inverse. I'm confident this can unlock a significant change in our business scale. Additionally, we are nearing licensing agreements for original casino content and plan to kickstart a B2B business in the coming months. Apart from opening up a new line of revenue for the company, we believe the interest expressed in our in-house casino game IT is very validating of our game development strategy, which we have also seen internally based on the performance of cash and dash, which is our most recent game released late last year. As Debbie noted in her remarks, we will continue to manage our working capital very tightly. All the initiatives I've described are not capital intensive, but more a matter of redeploying organizational resources around these new priorities. We recently undertook some workforce rationalization consistent with the need to pivot towards new skill sets. We feel confident we have rebalanced our team to support these focused initiatives. So with all that said, we do expect our expenses to remain flat or trend down over the coming quarters. The growth signal we are seeing in these initiatives and as demonstrated by some of the early figures provided today is extremely motivating for us and represents just the beginning of the growth potential we believe both the IT and its hope for our business. With that said, at this point, we'll open up the call for Q&A so operator you can provide the instructions. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star 1 to withdraw your question. Press star 2. Again, if you'd like to ask a question, press star 1. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from Jack VanderArty from Maxim Group. Please go ahead. Great. Okay. Good morning, Stephen. And welcome aboard to Demi as well. Congratulations. So I appreciate the update and thanks for taking my questions. Stephen, can we just maybe touch on the rivalry token a bit further? It's definitely a key focus of yours now and you're already seeing sounds like some tangible results. So that 1.7 million of additional revenue in the third quarter. Let's try to understand a bit. Is that gross gaming revenue? Is that net revenue? I'm going to count on maybe perspective. How do we think of that? And then how do we expect that to wrap throughout the rest of the year based on where you are? I know it's early stage. Thanks. Yeah. The exact accounting treatment, I can't specify at this stage. I mean, this is, but this is revenue that is, you know, right kind of into our pants and get cash for the bank. It's, you know, accessible for us. So it is essentially users or not saying various groups that have pre-purchase the token ahead of its release, which they would want to do for various different reasons and different benefits. You think of it as, you know, pre-ordering a book that an author is releasing in the future and then the author has to deliver you the book. People have pre-purchase the token and then we have to deliver them the token. And again, there would be various reasons why they would want to do that. So, yeah, this is in addition to just like our ongoing, let's say, gaming business. But obviously it's tied to it because the token is going to interface and be a key piece of utility within that business. So, yeah, in terms of the actual ramp, we do expect to show more than the 1.7 within Q3. And then, yeah, without giving kind of guidance, but another number that we expect to be kind of as meaningful in Q4 as well. So it will continue to be kind of a core part of, I guess, our revenue profile certainly for the remainder of this year. Okay, great. And then, you know, the B2B licensing update, that's an exciting opportunity. I think that would be a completely new revenue stream for you guys, which I imagine would be higher margin as well. Any additional color there, I mean, you mentioned one opportunity in the near term here. Is that an exclusive opportunity? Do you expect more B2B opportunities? Just any more kind of bigger picture, full color of what the B2B strategy is in your view of it? Yeah. And if it relates to any new markets, thanks. Kind of appreciative in talking about this one for a little bit. It just turns out, it's not operationally the easiest thing in the world to take a business entity and build original casino games for itself and then turn around and start servicing other people with that content, which also requires, depending on the jurisdiction, licenses, because you have to become a supplier of gaming content, right? Let alone that contracts and all the kind of things you need to do. We essentially right now are zeroing in on a relationship that will distribute the games across the world. I would say kind of more gray market. So this is like an aggregator type product where we would be a participant in a casino aggregator. And then another would be we are zeroing in also on a potential opportunity and a very, very large regulated geography with, yes, like an individual operator that is going to look a little bit more like an exclusive, exclusive relationship. And again, they all have their, they both have their different kind of quirks in terms of timing. The larger color gray market aggregator is a little quicker and easier. The regulated market one is a little challenging because yes, you, it's not just the, being able to service that specific type of, the best specific provider, but also be able to legally, within a regulated market, be a supplier of licensed casino games, meaning even the existing content that we have in our existing gaming content, along with a bunch of other new games that we're developing and are going to be released, needs certification. We've got certification in terms of obviously the way we're offering it on our current product, but it may not exactly meet the spec of specific regulators and specific markets that will have slightly different specs for the licensing of casino content that can be supplied. So that's just what it made us take a little longer and why we've been talking about it for, I guess, two quarters now. But yeah, we're in a process of closing those. There's been no deviation from those happening. It's, it's just, yeah, it's just, honestly, purely a timing thing at this point. Okay, got it. And, yeah, I do want to get, I want to revisit your, your profitability guidance for the back of the year and just kind of understand, just kind of understand the levers a little bit, just give them the trade, you know, the folks on VIP users and the crypto token, but also keeping in mind the handle is kind of more efficient spend for maybe lower handle, but you're, you're converting a lot of it. So how do we get there? What's your view of how you get the profitability? What are those levers? Is it largely cost cuts? Is it margin improvement? Is it incremental revenues? Help, help pick the picture. Yeah, so the same levers we've spoken about in the past, which is we're driving margin as hard as we possibly can, which you can kind of see in the results, obviously. So that that's going to help a lot of the, let's say some of the rationalization and changes that we made around workforce and even marketing spend. We initiated effectively right start of Q3. So a little bit of that, some of that's obviously going to be shown there for like in the Q3 results, but none of it was shown in Q2 in terms of some of those opx reduction. So that will help and we're, as we said in the remarks, we're looking to make additional cuts around, you know, certain areas of, let's say, marketing spend where we can find even more efficiency in terms of what we're doing without materially deviating the ongoing profile of the business. So being able to push margin, continue to push margin higher, continue to cut costs. Again, there was some cost cutting that was done earlier. The quarter of not reflected in Q2 to touch it more that would, yeah, therefore offset some of the overall operating expenses within within Q3 and then Q4 and beyond. We've got that new revenue stream in the form of rivalry token that is not insignificant. Right. If you look at 1.7 relative to, let's say, as a percentage of that revenue, we can put it in this quarter. It's fairly decent. We're also expecting to show more than the 1.7 in Q3. And then again, something similar in Q4. This is like quite additive. You know, you're talking like a 30, 40% increase, right? In revenue profile. So the combination of those three things alone, give us confidence in terms of just like managing our liquidity profile and our ability to push toward profitability. And then yes, like the last one is driving margin as hard as we possibly can. Obviously, so this is a part of the industry, as I said in my remarks, that we always obviously know and existed. We weren't naive to the fact that VIP and high value players is an important driver for the industry. We just had a very specific thesis that did not really have the lens of the company turning its attention towards that type of player. They obviously exist within our database. We've seen them come through. Are they at successful as, let's say, the lower value player that retains extraordinary well relative to industry? No, they're not because we did not focus on them. So, you know, the ratio of how many VIP players you need for help to, let's say, a typical lower value player is massive. You need to just satisfy and make a few of those players successful to equate to a fairly decent amount of growth. So, yes, we do expect that that initiative is going to start bearing fruit probably September, but then pushing much harder in October, November, December, meeting Q4. So, that is like another layer that on top of everything I said earlier that just gives us confidence still in our overall positioning and direction we're going. And then the last one would be, but it's just a little bit more of an unknown because, again, we can't perfectly nail down the timing of when the token gets released just because there's things out of our control. You know, one of them is like exchange-less things like you list your token on crypto exchanges, getting list on crypto exchanges. It's not some, you know, one, two, three simple step process. It's lots of different factors and it's not a thing you, again, perfectly control, but it's the thing that we need. That's not even included in anything I mentioned. And then releasing the token in terms of what we've seen for precedent of what releasing a token to a user base and attracting the kind of, let's say, crypto gamblers that come in to receive tokens and participate in that kind of economy, that is another additive growth factor. Again, we're currently expecting to contain that also within 2024 at this point with what we're seeing. I'm just qualifying that there's some unknowns that may push it further. But if we see that also in 2024, then that becomes like another lever. So, yeah, there's a lot like at our disposal obviously right now and clearly we feel we have enough tools to be able to deliver. Okay, that's really helpful, Steve, and I appreciate that. Maybe just one more question. Thoughts on just kind of the overall new major regulated gaming markets. What's your perspective on the Brazil market? Is rivalry actively pursuing that market? How does this impact you? I think it's on track to be one of the third largest regulated markets in the world, but I think it's on track to open stores in 2025 early. Is there a place for any Ferrari expansion opportunities in Brazil or anywhere else that you touched on? Yeah, it's obviously like all these markets look different in terms of how they transform into a local life market. So, we're not 100% sure at this point. I think we're expecting the Brazilian market to look a lot like other markets in latin and other geographies where given the nature of how the licensing regime has come together, there's just a high degree of uncertainty in terms of what's going to be economic, who will be economic by participating with a local license versus not. So, I think at this point, like we're still obviously in the evaluation phase and haven't really pushed too hard in that direction at this point. Yeah, and then in terms of other global markets, you know, not anything to really comment on and not something we're really looking at right now. The priority for us is given, we see a higher return on invested capital through that regime that we do through others right now. Okay, great. Well, hey, it's great to see the margin improvement in your contractor profitability. So, I look forward to tracking that in your crypto development as well as those ramp. That's it for me. Thanks. Perfect. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press a star one. And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Stephen for closing comments. Yeah, thanks, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. As always, you can shoot me down offline and we can continue the conversation there. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.
