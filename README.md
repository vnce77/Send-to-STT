With that, let me turn it over to Alia. Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us in today's event in conjunction with the International Aid Society meeting. Today, we'll provide an in-depth review of our HIV treatment and prevention pipeline, as well as the opportunity that stands before us to help more people at risk for, or living with, HIV infection. Our commitment to HIV started at the very beginning of the AIDS epidemic, and over the years, we've been responsible for creation of the prototype of each of the potent antiretrovirals that are designated as anchors of HIV treatment regiments. Now I joined Merck in 1995. At that time, Merck had just announced the results of the Croix-a-Vin Phase III program that led to the licensure of this Proteus inhibitor anchor medicine within weeks of submission. The company had also discovered the first NNRTI, a fibrance, a drug that became the anchor medicine in Atripla, the first single tablet regimen for HIV treatment. After these successes, we continued to innovate. We discovered that integrase strand transfer inhibitor or insti-class of anchor medicines, and we launched isentress, which is the prototype for this class. Iterations on isentress' profile led to development of instis that have become the most common anchors in HIV therapy regiments today. We've continued our innovation by ensuring availability of drugs for pediatrics, even down to newborns. More recently, our goal has been to find new types of antiretrovirals with high barriers to resistance and potency to help enable reductions in the burden of HIV treatment and prevention regiments. With the in-licensing of a slasher veer from Yamasa, we introduced a new class of anchor medicine, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, NRTTI. Deraboring a slasher veer is a first investigation of regimen in the NRTTI era. Now, Merck remains active in the field of HIV research because collectively, the HIV treatment and prevention community has yet to reach full control and prevention of HIV, as defined by the UNA's 2030 goals. There still remains significant unmet need globally in HIV, with currently approximately 40 million people living with HIV. An estimated 1.3 million people were infected with HIV in 2023, which equates to about 3,500 new infections per day. For these individuals, it has proven difficult to remove the stigma associated with HIV. We intend to be part of the solution for the continued unmet need in HIV treatment and prevention worldwide. So how are we going to do that? We aspire to be the first in class and best in class with our NRTTI's, which we hope will serve as important roles in both treatment and prep for prevention. NRTTI's inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase through immediate and delayed chain termination after incorporation into viral DNA. These agents also block reverse transcriptase translocation, preventing nucleotide incorporation. NRTTI's are potent and long-acting molecules, as exemplified by our candidate medicine for prep, which is being studied in a phase three trial at 11 milligrams once monthly. Because of this, NRTTI's may be appropriate for weekly, monthly, and potentially even longer interval regiments. A longer dosing interval has the potential to reduce treatment failure due to non-compliance, to offer additional treatment options and to reduce stigma. Our clinical trials have shown that at the appropriate doses, NRTTI's have had favorable efficacy, safety, and drug-drug interaction profiles, features especially important in older individuals and those people with comorbidities. Finally, our regiments are instantly free, reserving this important class of therapies for later, if needed. Now, our current in-line portfolio includes the original in-state eccentric, as well as cusfaltro, or dorabering, and dilstrigo, which is a fixed dose combination of dorabering, TDF, and 3TC. Dorabering is an important part of the current portfolio, but it's also in our current investigational tube drug, a slantravir-based regimen. It is an NRTI with favorable efficacy and safety profiles. In the near term, we will leverage our experience with dorabering to create a single tablet regimen with the slantravir, our leading NRTTI candidate. Now, Liz will review the data for this regimen. It's been filed in the U.S. and a fiduciary data has been set for April 28th, 2026. We've also invested heavily in our once weekly treatment regiments, which can reduce the burden of adherence to one-seventh, compared with daily regiments, and advantage for individuals with busy or complicated lives. The first of these investigational weekly treatment regiments will combine a slantravir with lenticapadir, and this is part of our ongoing collaboration with Gilead. This regimen leverages the potency of a slantravir and the proven trapper occurred of lenticapadir to create a two-drug regimen. Our long-term expertise in NRTIs has enabled us to discover several candidates with different pharmacologic profiles. One of these is eulonivirin, which we are studying in combination with the slantravir as a weekly single tablet regimen. The slantravirgulo has the potential to be the smallest tablet to prove, and one with a favorable DDI profile. Control of HIV transmission requires multiple PrEP options. We're very excited about the potential of NK-8527, which is being studied as a once monthly oral PrEP pill. It's a very small tablet that can be used easily and in a discrete manner, and we think it's going to be very important globally. We also have intensive research efforts to look at new therapies, not only longer-term, longer-acting, longer half-life medicines within the classes we've talked about already, but also new classes of medicine. We've been at the forefront of developing anchor medicines in HIV with features to enable different attacks on the HIV virus. We believe those opportunities also exist in our preclinical and early clinical pipelines. As we move forward to the next period of future innovation in HIV, we'll be considering our ability to develop long-acting formulations, which include assets in the family of NRT-TIs and also in the family of NRT-TIs. These leverage our expertise in those classes of drugs. We also have collaborations with Gilead and a variety of options in both treatment and PrEP under development. We're also thinking hard about how we will leverage our expertise to bring forward either CURE or long-term control or reset approaches. One of these approaches of interest is the RT-TAC mechanism of action. These are NRT-I's that have the additional effect feature of selectively killing HIV-infected cells. We're currently evaluating candidate medicines in early development. So with that, I'd like to turn the virtual podium over to Liz, who's going to be telling us more about the current pipeline focusing on the results we presented recently at CORE as well as an IAS this week. Liz? Thank you, Elia. I am very excited today to be here with you to share more about our expansive HIV pipeline, which has continued to make great progress. Today, we'll be highlighting the four programs that are currently in late-stage development in our HIV pipeline. These programs are anchored on our NRT-TI molecules and are leveraging the properties of this class. Each program has generated data that we think is really exciting and support the progression of these programs. We have three programs in development for treatment that are anchored by its law trivia, including a one-sail-y oral treatment program with Deravoring and his law trivia, which has recently filed the initial MBA in the U.S. based on data in adult participants who are virologically stable. The Pajupa day for this filing is set for April in 2026. In addition, we have filed an application for Deravoring and his law trivia in Japan. Then we have our first weekly oral treatment with his law trivia in combination with Lenek Hapavir, which we are developing in partnership with Calead and which is in phase three development. We have a once-monthly oral prep option with a new investigational NRT-TI, MK8527, which is on the cusp of starting phase three. Finally, we have our wholly internal oral weekly treatment regimen candidate, where is law trivia, is being combined with our new investigational NRT-I, Ula Nivoreen, which has recently started phase two. With these four programs, we have the potential for four NDAs to be filed over the next few years. This is truly exciting for us, as we see that each of these products can be a potentially important option for people living with HIV or people who are at risk of acquiring HIV. The NDAs for deriving a glass of beer is currently under review by the FDA, and the basis for this filing was two pivotal studies in virulogically suppressed adults who have no history of treatment failure. Importantly, in this program, this is the first set of phase three studies where we were able to demonstrate that a two-drive regimen that does not contain two or three-drug regimens containing an integration inhibitor. The two phase three trials, protocol 51 and protocol 52, were conducted in virulogically stable participants. In each trial, they were randomized to either continue on their baseline treatment, or switch to deriving as latch of beer. In protocol 51, the baseline treatment was background antiretroviral therapy, which included different kinds of two and three drug regimens. And in protocol 52, the comparator was spectacular via FGC TAF. In both trials, we were able to demonstrate strong efficacy results. In both trials, deriving a latch of beer was not inferior to the comparator as demonstrated by the primary end point results at week 48 based on people having RNA levels about 50 copies per ML. This is on the left of each of the figures. As you can see in the figures, the second set of bars on the right showed that there were high rates of virulogic suppression greater than 90% in both trials. Importantly, there was no treatment for merger resistance to either deragoring or as latch of beer that was observed in either study. And the tolerability in CFP profiles were comparable in each of these trials to the comparator. Also important to note is that we saw that total lymphocyte and CD4 count changes over the course of these studies was similar between deriving a latch of beer and the comparator regimens. These are very promising results because this is the first two drug regimen that does not contain an integrase inhibitor that's demonstrated comparable efficacy with three drug regimen containing an integrase inhibitor. Our finally U.S. was accepted for an indication in virulogically suppressed adults. We have another study, protocol 53, being conducted in treatment naive adults which has completed enrollment. And we expect that the week 48 data will read out by the end of this year and will be presented next year at a scientific meeting. We expect these data to support the initial application in the EU and to support a U.S. label expansion as well. In addition to a once daily regimen, including a latch of beer, we are also developing two once weekly two drug oral treatment regimens both containing a latch of beer. And we think that each of these will be an important option for patients who desire a weekly oral regimen as a way to shift away from daily treatment. We believe that once weekly oral regimens will help to address challenges around tilt the teeth that people living with HIV often grapple with. There's lots of virulent cap of beer which we're developing with GILIAD. Our partner on this program is currently Phase 3 and we've only completed enrollment for those studies. This combination is being studied and virulogically suppressed adults and will include a loading dose strategy followed by a single tablet administered once weekly. We are excited that this has the potential to be the first weekly oral treatment regimen to market and the first complete long-acting oral treatment regimen for HIV. The is latch of your urine program has recently started Phase 2 and is currently being evaluated in adults who are virulogically stable. But we also have plans to study this in adults who are treatment naive. This regimen is differentiated from this latch of beer on a cap of air by the inclusion of euloneverine which is an investigational and an RTI. It's being studied at a dose of 200 milligrams in combination with this latch of beer which we think will have the potential for a more simplified regimen as a single tablet that has the potential to be smaller than these latch of air on a cap of air tablet without requiring a loading dose. And we also believe importantly that this has the potential to have a favorable safety and DDI profile. For the is latch of your urine on a cap of air program we've conducted a Phase 2 study to evaluate this combination and presented these data last year at CROI and at ID Week. What's shown on the slide are the week 48 results that were presented at ID Week. In this trial as you can see where the comparator was a spectacular beer MTC TAF is latch of your lana cap of your resulted in virologic suppression at high rates that were similar to what we're seeing in the comparator group. Importantly there were no participants that were discontinued due to decreases in CD4 T cell or lymphocyte counts and the overall lymphocyte and CD4 counts were similar across treatment groups. These are the data that gave us confidence to move this program into Phase 3. In this program we're calling the island program this was initiated at the end of last year and enrollment recently completed. Island 1 and Island 2 are being conducted in adults who are realistically suppressed and in Island 1 the comparator is a spectacular FDC TAF. This is a double blinded randomized control trial. Island 2 in contrast is an open label randomized trial and here the comparator is baseline antiretroviral therapy which can include different 2 and 3 drug regimens. Both of these trials are expected to read out the 48-week results in mid-2026 and we look forward to seeing these results. You're a nivering ORMT-8507. This is our novel investigational and NRTI and we are moving us forward in development in combination with is latch of your as part of our Holy internal Merck oral weekly treatment regimen. This week we presented data from this program at IAS. Uonibrine is a potent NRTI. This was demonstrated in a Phase 1B proof of concept study where we saw excellent virologic activity. We did conduct a prior phase 2B study where we dose-range Uonibrine in combination with a higher dose of his latch of air. And this study, while stopped early, did provide helpful supporting data for the combination and for the selection of the Uonibrine dose. As shown on the slide, the predicted Uonibrine exporters with a 200 once weekly dose met the TK threshold to cover wild type and common NRTI experience. We've also generated data to demonstrate that there is no clinically meaningful drug interaction between his latch of air and Uonibrine and that repeat dosing of Uonibrine has no adverse effect on total lipocyte counts and CE4 counts. The Phase 2 study of the combination is currently enrolling and we look forward to seeing the results next year for week 24 primary endpoint. But in addition to creating meaningful options for treatment, we believe it's really important as well to provide meaningful options for HIV prep. We're very excited that we have the opportunity with MK8527 and that we've made progress in advancing this program. The concept of a once monthly oral pill to prevent HIV infection has many potential benefits for people who are at high risk for HIV. MK8527 is being uniquely developed only for prep and we believe it can have a potential very important impact on global public health. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of this molecule, we anticipate a fast onset of protection so that within an hour of taking the first dose of MK8527, people would be able to have a month of protection from HIV. There would also be no need for a loading dose. In addition with a discretion that's allowed with a small once monthly oral pill, we believe this will be easy to use and address concerns around stigma that are associated with taking a pill for prep every day. And this will also, we believe, offer different ways for implementation that may be more convenient for people compared to an injection that patients would have to go to a physician's office to receive. Importantly based on the data seen so far, MK8527 has the potential to provide favorable efficacy, safety, and DDI profile for those people who get benefit from using a PAP. This week at IIS, we've presented phase two data for MK8527 and these are the results that supported advancing this program to phase three. MK8527 is an N-I-T-T-I with the same mechanism of action as is last year. It is also highly potent and has excellent resistance in vitro. The phase two study results informed our selection of a dose for phase three trials, which will be starting imminently. As you can see in the top figure, which shows the study schema, we conducted a phase two dose-ranging study of MK8527 compared to a placebo, where we looked at three different doses of MK8527. The study was conducted in people who are at low risk for HIV infection and evaluated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. As you can see from the concentration over time figure, the pharmacokinetic results support monthly dosing of MK8527 for PrEP. Based on the modeling that's been conducted from these data, we selected a dose of 11 milligrams to advance into the phase three program. Importantly, all three doses were well tolerated and demonstrated the safety profile that was comparable across the different doses of MK8527 and to the placebo groups. So we are moving forward to initiate the phase three expressive program for MK8527 PrEP. This program is comprised of two phase three trials, expressive 10 and expressive 11. Expressive 10 is being conducted in adolescent girls and young women at greater likelihood of HIV exposure. And expressive 11 is being conducted in populations at greater risk of HIV exposure, which includes men who have sex with men and transgender individuals. Both of these trials are large studies evaluating MK8527 once monthly against the daily oral comparator F2C PDF. Of note, expressive 10 will include not only older adolescents, meaning 16 to 17 years old, but also women who become pregnant while on the trial may opt to stay on the study. So we anticipate data in pregnancy and lactation in this trial. Expressive 10 is being conducted in partnership with the Gates Foundation. And this is a collaboration that both the Gates Foundation and we are very excited about. We do see the great potential here to bring forward a meaningful option for people around the world, as well as an opportunity to impact the global epidemic in areas where there's still very high rates of infection such as sub-Saharan Africa. Expressive 11 is slated to start any day now, and we anticipate the first participant will be involved in early August. And this study will be conducted globally. So we look forward to the initiation of the Phase III program and sharing the progress with you in the future. With that, I will turn this call over to Turkey. Thank you, Aliz. Good morning, everyone. As we've mentioned before, Merck has a long and rich legacy in HIV. We have a track record dating back to the early 2000s of working in partnership with governments and global partners, such as the Gates Foundation, to enable broad, sustainable global access to our HIV innovations. I'm proud to have been part of several of these important access initiatives when I let global marketing for HIV at our company. And before that, when I served as managing director for Merck in South Africa, it is humbling to now be in a position to potentially bring forward four very important options for both treatment and prep in the near future. HIV is a large market that is anticipated to continue to grow rapidly, primarily driven by demand for prep. The treatment market is also expected to continue to grow to approximately $25 billion by the mid-2030s. As you heard from earlier in the presentation, high-end demand needs remain in HIV. Up to one in every five people living with HIV switch their treatment regimens annually due to tolerability, resistance, or the desire for simpler regimens. On the prep side, a substantial opportunity exists to bring new options into the market. Including a monthly oral option like MK8527. This is particularly exciting for people who are seeking flexibility and the discretion that comes with having a monthly pill that can protect against HIV. The HIV landscape, next slide, the HIV landscape is continuing to evolve. And the needs of the community are becoming more and more clear. We have done a lot of work in market research interacting with patients, advocacy groups, providers, and other members of the community. Four main insights have emerged from those interactions. First and foremost, people with HIV are aging. Currently, half of people living with HIV in the U.S. are 50 or older. Roughly one-third of people living with HIV have core mobilities. It is therefore important to bring forward suitable options for these individuals. The second insight is on the growing need for simplification and two drug regimens in particular. People on treatment are wanting less drug while enabling viral control and the efficacy that these regimens provide. The third insight is a need for additional options and choice because adherence challenges continue. With many people living with HIV missing doses on their existing treatments. Finally, stigma continues to be a challenge. As Ellie have noted, almost half of adults have discriminatory attitudes towards people living with HIV. It is important to be able to bring forward options that allow for discrete dosing and potentially have minimal interaction with the healthcare system. Approximately one-third of people, when asked, would prefer long-acting oral options for both treatment as well as for prep. This is precisely what we will offer as we continue to develop our exciting pipeline. On the treatment side, we have door easel as a potential daily oral regimen. Isolen, in collaboration with Gilead, as a potential first oral weekly regimen and Isololo as a wholly-owned potential weekly oral regimen. For these options, these options provide virologically-surprised, suppressed people living with HIV with a simpler two-drug regimen that do not contain an instinct. This can be particularly meaningful for people who are getting older and for whom drug-drug interactions, highly metabolic toxicities, and other tolerability issues may be a concern. Our new treatment options may be able to offer choices for both switch as well as treatment naive populations of people living with HIV. Importantly, they can reduce pill burden with weekly dosing for isolen and isololo. On the prep side, we're aiming to launch the first and only monthly tablet for HIV prevention with MK8527, our investigational NRTTI that has been specifically developed for prep and prep only. This is important because there will be less concern about the potential for resistance when thinking about use of the same molecule for treatment and for prep. MK8527 has the potential to enable fast onset of protection within one hour of intake with no loading dose needed. It would provide discrete monthly oral dosing to meet the preferences of many people seeking long-acting protection who do not want injections. We expect this program will be meaningful for public health on a global basis and we fully recognize the responsibility our company has to work with partners to address public health needs both in high income countries as well as in low and middle income countries. We feel we are well positioned to provide important progress for people impacted by HIV around the world. Early this year, we laid out the components of our expansive late stage pipeline that comprise a potential revenue opportunity over 50 billion dollars by the mid 2030s, putting MFN aside. With that, we see an opportunity of greater than 5 billion dollars for our late stage HIV portfolio which consists of four impactful new product launches anticipated over the next few years. The first of which is door easel for daily oral treatment. Last week, FDA accepted for review the NDA of door easel and set up a doofed date of April 28, 2026. This would be the first regimen containing an NRTTI to be approved by the FDA. It would also be the first complete two drug regimen that does not contain an in-seat. Subsequently, we have a potential first long-acting oral treatment to be approved with easel and a partnership with Gilead which is currently in phase three and has primary completion dates next year. Next, we have our potential once monthly oral prep MK8527 which will begin in phase three immediately. Finally, we have easel hula which combined with our investigational next generation long-acting and an RTI hula nivirin with high barrier to resistance. Isel hula which is fully owned by Merck and currently in phase two has the potential to be the smallest bill approved for once weekly treatments which also does not require load interest. It's greater than five billion dollar opportunity on a non-risk adjusted basis underlines our confidence in this pipeline of HIV treatment and prevention options. Our excitement to bring forward these innovations is mashed by the enthusiasm of the community. As we heard this very week at IAS. It identifies our important presence in HIV since day one. We're eager to leverage our commercial engine and our global footprint to bring forward these great new options for people impacted by HIV around the world. And with that, I turn the call back to Elliot. Thank you, Turkey. From all that has been shared, it should be evident that we are highly interested in continuing to contribute to HIV treatment and prevention. We're confident in our ability to play an important role with these programs we've laid out. We are pioneering potentially novel options including with an NRTTI anchor medicine that has a unique mechanism of action. High potency, high barrier to resistance, favorable DDI profile, and the capability for longer acting impacts in treatment and prevention regimens. We anticipate four new approvals in the near term and we're working with speed to ensure that we can get these important medicines to people globally. We continue to work with the community to ensure that HIV treatment and prevention remains a top priority for public health officials. We want to make sure that people are not defined by their HIV. Firstly, by preventing infection. And secondly, by bringing forward regimens that enable people to control their HIV without having to think about it all since. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Peter. Thank you, Eliov. Surely, we're ready for Q&A. Before we get started, two things please. First, Katherine Hayward, Senior Vice President, US Pharma, will be available for questions. And secondly, if I could request that questioners please limit the subject matter today to our HIV program. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question anytime by pressing star two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press star one. In one moment, please, for our first question. Our first question comes from Tron Nguyen with UBS. Your mind is open. You may ask your question. Oh, great. Thanks for taking our questions. We've just got two on 85-27. So I guess first, what makes you confident that 85-27 doesn't have the lymphocyte lowering issues when used at higher doses for the monthly combos? And then secondly, and perhaps linked to the first question, but is there a roadmap for injections for longer durations for this product, like at four or six months, or even resuming the implant development for 12 months, which you previously had for a slasher there, or can you not push that dose higher because of those lymphocyte lowering issues? Thank you. Right, I'll take that, Cecilia. We have had an extensive de-risking program for MK8527 that followed the same path that led to the successful de-risking of MK8527. I'm sorry, MK8591 or a slasher there. We have the right models and the right clinical data that have given us that confidence, and equally the data that we've presented today this week at IAS, and also reviewed extensively with regulatory authorities, has convinced them that we are on the right track here with a drug that has enormous potential. So we're very excited about that. With respect to your second question, we're exploring a variety of different injectable options. That work is in earlier stages of development, and we're confident that we'll be able to bring forward medicines that will allow for a whole variety of different durations of therapy, and hopefully as long as possible. Thanks. Great, thanks for our next question. Will you surely? Thank you. And if a question comes from Mohit Benzo, with Wells Fargo, you may ask your question. Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. Just a couple of questions. One is that it does seem like market might shift to injectables if you're in longer term for, especially for the prep market. What does your market research suggest which makes you more confident around the monthly order? Yes, it is monthly. And then number two, with the slatter wave of Arlo combo, you are combining two NRTI. So is there any potential for added toxicity, given that they are two similar mechanisms, and one of them did cause at high doses? I'll leave for the patient. Thank you. Let me start by the second with the correction. The slatter wave of Arlo are two actually two different mechanisms of action. The slatter wave, I know that the letters are very similar, but they're completely different mechanisms of action. The slatter wave is an NRTTI, and you'll never even have an NRTI. Natural confusion, but they're different. We don't expect any, and we've actually do risk both molecules pretty well, including a long duration, dosing of your own earring monotherapy, just to make sure it has absolutely no lymphocyte effect. So that combination, I think, will be a very exciting one. With respect to the Q-monthly, I'm going to turn that to Chirfi to answer. Yeah, no, thank you for the question, Maite. So I think it's important to highlight that despite the availability of daily options for prep, availability of injectables, still 1.3 million people get infected on an annual basis. So clearly, more is needed to protect individuals who want to avoid HIV infection around the world. So we believe, when we did the market research, we presented options to these individuals. About a third of them have signaled preference for a monthly oral option to protect themselves. And the reason for that is really the fact that, you know, it would be more convenient for them. It would give them the option of having a potent, rapid protection within an hour, in the case of MK-2527, sorry. They could take this medicine in the comfort of their home. You could think about telemedicine in this context, where individuals would not need to necessarily go to the doctor to get their injection. So we believe that, you know, this oral monthly prep option would actually expand access and facilitate access to many individuals in the United States and around the world. So we're excited about this opportunity, frankly. You should have been at IAS. You would have heard the community super enthusiastic about this monthly oral option. Great. Thanks, Maite. Next question, please, Shirley. Thank you. And this question comes from Evan Sigerman with BMO Capital Market. If your mind is open, you may ask your question. Hi, Mac Mopmanon, and thanks for taking our question. Thinking about MK-8527 again, can you talk about how a mark may be able to capture a greater opportunity in the lower risk patients, not exposed HIV? Also, I know this is not the majority of the market opportunity in this patient population, but could you maybe contextualize how you think about the opportunity for these patients? Thanks. Sir, he wants to take that. Yeah, so for us, the opportunity is so huge in the people who are at risk. As I mentioned, 1.3 million. We're getting infected on an annual basis. So our studies were done specifically in those populations. And so this is really the opportunity that we're going to go after in the coming periods. Thank you, Malcolm. Next question, please, Shirley. Thank you. And this question comes from a solid hater with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Great. Thanks for taking the question and doing the call. Two quick ones. First for PrEP. Can you maybe talk about how you'll position and what market share you think is possible versus generic daily oils? Gilead to discover you would also be generic around the time you launch. And also against Gilead to net a cap of here, where they will likely be a yearly injection formulation when you launch as well. And then second on treatment. How do you think about how much share you could pull from Victoria with the Gilead thought partner weekly or oral? And how might that compete with Gilead's wholly owned weekly or will it both make it to market, recognizing, of course, that the latter is currently on a clinical hold? Thank you. Just, this is Elliott. I'll just make a couple of general comments. I think it's really important in the PrEP space to have options that enable people to have discrete and low compliance burden options. When we talk to folks around the in both high and middle and low income countries, the idea of having a monthly pill discrete at home telemedicine or not having to go to health care center to get an injection is a real home run winner for them. I think it's a very important one. And in terms of the treatment, again, we have, there'll be a lot of options needed for treatment. We have, with our two weekly, we have the power of working together with Gilead. We'll have our own, our own, in wholly owned drug that will have some very unique properties and a broader label. In terms of looking at the opportunities, I'll turn it over to Turkey for more contextualization. Yeah, so I would, you know, I would go back to what I said about PrEP to start with and Elliott summarized it nicely in terms of, you know, what the community is wanting, the options of the community is seeking full protection. I think the advantage of MK8527 really is the fact that it is, you know, a small pill. It works very, very fast within an hour of intake. You get a full protection for a whole month and you even have forgiveness up to seven days beyond that. And you can take it with the discretion that Elliott talked about and you don't have to go to the doctor and get a needle injection and so on and so forth. So we believe that, you know, many, many individuals will choose this option. And market research suggested about a third of people would opt for this, for their protection, if you were available. And then on the treatment side, again, I agree with what Elliott said. You know, we believe that our weekly options are going to be well positioned and we will have a meaningful share for both. Isalen, when approved, as well as Isalulo, when approved, these are very good options that provide, you know, differentiated benefits for patients going forward. Great. Thanks, Asa. Next question, please, Shirley. Thank you. Our next question comes from Louisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open. Let me ask your question. Hello, thank you for the call. On MK8527, I wonder if you could comment on the amount of data you have on drug interactions, including perhaps recreational drug use. And then secondly, on your sales ambitions by therapy area, they do tend to arrive in $5 billion increments. So given the amount of data that you have in house in HIV, could you comment on whether your over $5 billion sales potential has increased towards $10 billion? And if not, why not? Thank you. Great. Well, maybe we'll start with a DDI question and I'll ask Liz to comment on that. Yeah, thank you, Aleve. So MK8527's potential for drug interactions as well. And this is based on the preclinical profiling that's been done for this compound, as well as some phase one dedicated studies that we've conducted. So we do think that overall the potential for meaningful DDI's is low with this compound. And I'll just add to that that, you know, these, the NRTTIs are the metabolism and such that it has that the drug drug interaction potential is really quite minor. You know, obviously we can't do direct drug drug interaction studies in people with recreational drugs, but we, but based on our understanding of what of the metabolism of those drugs, we don't anticipate any drug drug interactions there necessarily. Of course, you know, there's a lot of impurities in these drugs. We don't really know what might happen that unfortunately on an individual basis. When we talk about the commercial side. Yeah, I don't want to give, you know, we are confidence continues to be reinforced with respect to our HIV pipeline based on the data, obviously. What one thing I would give to you is that, you know, we believe that door easel, which will be the first out of the gate, is likely to be, in fact, the preferred switch option for many individuals who are going to be switched from their existing regimen, which usually contains an instinct, right? And so door easel being the first, you know, new class of NRTTIs, which provides robust viral control, right? You know, high barrier to resistance and the convenience and the tolerability and the DDI benefits that we've talked about. We believe that, and that is not, importantly, does not include an instinct. We believe that door easel would actually be the preferred switch option for those individuals. And just as we mentioned earlier, one in five patients treated with an HIV regimen will be switched on an annual basis. So this gives you an indication of how we're thinking about the opportunity for the first out of the gate. But similarly, we are equally excited about the weekly options going forward. And Louisa is Peter, so when we're asked about what's underappreciated at Merck, one of the subjects that we typically lead with is HIV. So when we look at consensus estimates, there's not a lot in models for our HIV pipeline and portfolio, and that's one of the reasons why we did this call today. We're very confident in the 5 billion plus opportunity that we've spoken about, and we're not going to update that today. But we look forward to continuing to see progress across this program, and hopefully, today's event will help you understand why we're so confident. Next question, please, Shirley. Thank you. Our next question comes from Courtney Breen with Bernstein. Your mind is open. You may ask your question. Hi, everyone. This is Courtney. Thanks for taking my question today. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the prep opportunity specifically. And one of the pieces that you've pointed out has been kind of the convenience and the ability to just kind of dose a monthly aural at home. What we've learned with the labeling update recently for yes-to-go, the Lenna Capaver asset from Gilead is that another key component that requires doctor visits is actually testing to ensure that the patient doesn't have HIV. And so for the injectables today for yes-to-go with the longer dosing interval of every six months, that's a six-month requirement, whereas for discovee, which is the daily aural, it's a three-monthly requirement for HIV testing to ensure that that patient hasn't contracted the disease. Can you give us some context as to what we should expect for the monthly aural? Would this be a requirement for an HIV test every month, every three months, or something even longer than that? Thank you so much. So Sally, I'll turn to Liz in a second, but I just say we can't anticipate labeling. Obviously that's something that we'll discuss with FDA. I point out that HIV testing can be done rather anonymously and also not necessarily through a visit to a hospital center. In terms of how we are doing it in the clinical trials, as alternative to Liz for comments. Yeah, thanks, Elliot. In the trials, we are testing for HIV status monthly, actually, in this trial. But this is not necessarily what we expect the position to be when we bring this product forward for regulatory submission. I mean, I think that every three months frequency that's associated with the daily options is something that we think is probably more realistic. Right, and although, again, we can't speculate on what FDA or other agencies would say, but considering the standard of care in the field, the ability to get HIV testing, again, without having to visit a hospital center is relatively well established. And I'll just add the reason why we're checking HIV status monthly is to understand if we do see any infections when they happen. So this is really to enable us to collect the kind of data that we need to really fully characterize any infections that do occur in the treatment, when participants are in treatment in this trial. So it's to answer a scientific question, but this is not what we expect in terms of how we'd be using the real world and how testing would be used. Great. Thanks, Courtney. Next question, please, Shirley. Thank you. And if question comes from Jeff Beecham with City Bank, your line is opening me after question. Great. Morning, guys. Thanks for the question and for doing this session. Just that too. The first is in the treatment setting, I was curious how you guys think about resistance, especially as you develop, you know, doublets in HIV from what is three or four drug combos today, and then how would you compare the resistance of ISO or yellow versus say an integrase or a capsid? And then the second question, more of a commercial one, PrEP, you've seen mostly a U.S.-based market, but what do you think is a tipping point for Europe or Asia more broadly adopting PrEP commercially? Thank you. Right, so with the first one on resistance, let me turn it over to Liz. Yeah, thank you. So I think when you think about resistance in the context of, you know, multi-drug HIV regimens, you know, the number of compounds is not really what's driving the emergence of resistance. And if you think about this, historically we went from three drug regimens being standard to now more recently, two drug regimens showing really excellent efficacy. And so what's really key, I think, based on the last 20 years that we've learned, is that you need to have at least one agent with a really strong barrier to resistance to protect the regimen. And I think this is often behind the concept of an anchor agent in an HIV treatment regimen. So with Isla Trivere, one of the features that got us really excited about this molecule is the potency. So you need to make sure you've got adequate potency and levels with the doses that you pick. And then also the resistance profile, meaning that Isla Trivere, if you've tested in vitro, really takes a while to get resistance-associated mutations detected. And the one that we do see is M184B, which is a relatively less problematic mutation. So this is why it's important when we're looking at our data in our phase three, deriving is larger for trials, that we saw no emergence of resistance to either Isla Trivere or deravine. And this is why the concept of Isla Trivere anchoring or treatment regimens is one that we've been talking about. Because we see this molecule as really bringing the potency and barrier to resistance that you need for a drug to anchor a regimen, whether it's a two drug regimen or a three drug regimen. Right, and I just would add that this is why we've chosen these two drug classes together. They're actually quite complimentary. One of the interesting things with Isla Trivere is that it actually some mutations that occur, the older medicines actually potentiate the effect of Isla Trivere. And so that is an interesting biological plus that we see. In addition to that, I think that we've shown in our studies, which is actually the most important thing, the lack of emergence of resistance. And I'll turn it over to Turkey to talk about the commercial elements. Yeah, so for prep outside of the US, you're quite right that today the prep market is disproportionately a US market. And so there are many reasons for that outside of the US. And I'm leaving the side the low income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and so forth, where there's actually quite a bit of prep use in the daily form and then going forward in the long acting as well. So if you look at other high income countries, there's still a lack of perception or risk by many individuals, low awareness of prep and concerns for side effects and the stigma associated with daily use of prep. And I think that by having Merck coming back with our global footprint, our commercial engine, we believe that we will actually have a make a meaningful difference in helping to develop the prep market in these other high income countries. We have done this in other therapeutic areas. We know how to reach consumers in many of those markets. We've done that and we believe that that engine will help us really enhance the level of awareness. And the once monthly oral option will help address many of those barriers that I just talked about. And finally, in terms of implementation, to have an option where you're not relying on going to the clinic with all the challenges of having a nurse in the clinic, in many of those countries, I think the monthly oral option will really help develop prep in those high income countries outside of the US. Great. Thanks, Jeff. Next question, please, Shirley. Thank you. Our next question comes from Val Mount-Mong. With Guggenheim, your line is open. You may ask your question. Great. Thanks for hosting this. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe one clinical one and one commercial. The one just on the ISO-UO combination. Can you talk about how that would differentiate from ISO-Lenn? I think they're both the weekly oral. And obviously you only own one. And the other one's shared with Juliet, but just curious from a clinical side, how you expect to differentiate there. And then maybe just in terms of on the commercial side, I can kind of go back to that $5 billion HIV pipeline potential that you've highlighted. Can you break that down further as you think about it? For US, for the next few years, or treatment was prepped, just kind of a little bit more of a sense of where the $5 billion or $5 billion plus would be coming from. Thank you. And let me take the clinical one. So a slasher varial nivering, I think will be, so for the both of which are very nice or terrific, that the slasher varial nivering will be a very small tablet and a very favorable DDI profile, a drug. That will also have a treatment naive indication. So you'll have a set of attributes that I think will be very important for some people, which is not to take away from the slasher varial on a capoeveer, which will have the potency of the slasher varial and the proven tract of the diploma capoeveer. So I think that these are going to be complementary drugs that will have very, very important uptake in different segments of the population. And the commercial site alternative to the trophy capoeve. You were not breaking down the $5 billion opportunity. We're equally excited about all four of these major innovations and we see opportunity, meaningful opportunity for each one of them. And cumulatively, we believe there will be greater than $5 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, we do anticipate significant opportunity outside of the US as well, based on our engine and our capabilities in those high-income countries outside of the US. Great. Thanks, mama. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question comes from parents Flynn, with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question for me. I guess on 85, 27, I noticed that you're taking the 11-meg dose forward, but it looks like 12-migs was studied. Not a significant difference there, but just wondering why that decision was made. And then on MK8239 plus LEN, I know you highlighted it early on. You didn't talk too much about it, but maybe just talk about the target profile there and timing of when we might see the phase one data. Thank you. So I'll take the first one and the last one. I was to talk about the 82-39. We chose the 11-milligram dose because we have a very strict modeling program that looks at all the different factors that are necessary for patients to, for individuals, I'm sorry, this is prepped, for individuals to have control. It could have been even lower dose. We had no issues with the 12-milligram dose either, but we went through a pretty rigorous algorithmic approach and chose the 11-milligram because it was the sweet spot for all the different attributes we wanted to get. There's no issues with them going to 12 or anything like that. It was just really just from a modeling point of view. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about the earlier developing compounds. Yeah, so MK-85, sorry, MK-8239, which we are developing in collaboration with Gilead. This is a model so that's part of our partnership, is in phase one. The phase one work is ongoing. So at this point, I don't have a time yet when we can share results from that study. But the intention here is, you know, this is a lot of our project that we think could be suitable for as a long-acting injectable to be included as part of potentially a long-acting, complete treatment regimen that's injectable. So that's the general concept behind the program, but it remains quite still early in development. Right, we're continuing to do our dosing and we're working through the details to make sure that the studies are done appropriately and move the sufficient rigor that regulatory authorities in both companies will feel comfortable, advance forward and have to have a look forward to presenting those data in due course. Great, thanks, Terrence. Next question, please. Thank you. And if question comes from Dana Gray-Bosh, the Thuring Partners, your line is opening me after a question. Well, I think for the question, I wonder if you could talk about payers for a moment from your market research. And of the attributes that have value, both for your treatment and prep around stigma and convenience and also DVI, which resonate across treatment and prep most with the payers. Katherine, maybe you'd like to address that? Of the U.S. specific situation, yes. Sure, I mean, I can provide a perspective from a U.S. pay standpoint related to some of the attributes. I think one thing that's really important and that is recognized by payers within the U.S. market is that effective treatment and prep requires individualization and optimization of treatment based on people's individual needs. And I think the importance of retaining choice and access to treatments will continue to be critical ultimately to achieve favorable clinical outcomes. Obviously, you know, improved adherence, the ability to actually take and stay on treatment is an important attribute for payers, clinical efficacy, and the ability to actually address unmet needs within our population of people living with HIV is also critically important as well. Yep. Now, what I would add is, you know, as people get older on their meds and get older with their HIV, obviously, you have to worry about co-mobile conditions, you have to worry about drug-bearing interactions, and those are attributes that are also important. And, you know, this is where our portfolio overall you know, anchored on the NRTTI class really is well differentiated. And we believe that we will be well positioned for, you know, early payer access. Right. Thanks, Dana. Next question, please, Shirley. Thanks. When this question comes from Richard Wagner, thank you, America. Your mind is opening me. Ask your question. Hello. Thank you for the question. Richard Wagner from Bank of America, and for Tim Anderson. During the presentation, Merck cited market research, indicating a one-third preference for a monthly oral regimen for PrEP. What can you say about the market demand for a once weekly regimen? I believe the target was described in the presentation as individuals with busy or complicated lives, and I wanted to get a better understanding of that. And then related, clearly, it seems to me that Merck is confident that there would be adherence advantages for once weekly and once monthly compared to once daily. It's easier for me to see that for the once monthly. But I would like to hear your thoughts on potential adherence advantages for once weekly orals. Thank you very much. Let me turn that to Turkey. Yeah. Yeah, just to clarify the insights from the research, Richard. So we put in front of individuals who are patients and non-patients, options for treatment as well as for PrEP. And about a third of those individuals on either category, right? Those who are, who have HIV and those who are at risk of contracting HIV, they opted for one third, long acting orals. So on the treatment side, this was a weekly treatment. On the PrEP side, it was a monthly PrEP. Just to clarify what I presented on the slide earlier. Right, and I think that in terms of adherence, the idea here is certainly once daily is complicated, once weekly allows you to say, right before the work week, I'm going to start. Or on the one day that I'm at home and not traveling or other kind of lifestyle issues, it certainly is great to have one seventh of the burden of a daily tablet. So I think that would be very useful. Obviously, we'll be monitoring this in the real world. But I think from the point of view of reducing the burden of adherence and HIV. And remember, you have to get take these drugs every day very, very aesthetically. It's not like cholesterol therapy. You miss a couple of days here and there. It's not a big deal. It's a big deal here. So having a once weekly approach, I think would be really quite life-changing for people. If I had one more point earlier, the other insight that we got from patients, these are patients, people who are living with HIV, is that on the daily regimens, you remind it every day that you have HIV in your body. So to have the option of taking your pill, a small pill, maybe every Sunday, or maybe whatever fits your lifestyle, has an emotional benefit in addition to the convenience benefit as well for these individuals. So you're not really stressed out every day. In case you happen to miss a pill or something. Thanks, Richard. Next question, please, Cheryl. Thank you. And this question comes from Steve Scallow with TD Securities. Your mind is open. You may ask your question. Hi. This is Chris. I'm Steve. Thanks for taking a question. We had two on MK8, 527. First, had a phase three trial sufficiently powered to show statistically superior efficacy to Travata, and is that the birth of success in second? Do you expect commercial launch for this asset before late 2028? Thank you. I'll ask Liz to talk about the phase three signs. So for the expressive trials, expressive 10, which is the study that's being conducted in women, that study is designed in power to be a superiority trial. That is the primary hypothesis. That is, yeah. And then on the commercial side. So we're not providing a specific date for launch. I mean, obviously we have to, you know, we're ready to go into phase three. Very excited about that. And then we'll just have to wait. We will obviously look forward to, you know, getting this to the finish line as quickly as possible. So we can bring it to people who want to be protected with this once monthly oral. Yeah, I'll add, I mean, these are event-driven trials, these phase three studies. Right. So, you know, we have estimates of how long I'll take to complete these studies that are reflected in the postings. But, you know, it's possible it could take a little bit longer or less time even. Yeah, great. Thank you. Next question, please Shirley. Thank you. Golf research. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Thanks for taking the question. So on MK8527 in the phase two, we saw one SAE of spontaneous abortion in six weeks of gestation. That was considered related to drugs. I know you mentioned in the expressive 10 trial that there'll be a generation in pregnancy and lactation patients. So can you walk us through the risk benefit of treatment here? Thanks. I'll turn that over to Liz. Yeah, so the decision to allow women in expressive 10 who become pregnant to stay on MK8527 if they choose to do so is based on the overall data from the program, which includes not just the clinical trial data, but also the non-clinical safety assessment in terms of safety to the embryo field toxicity and juvenile safety as well. And overall, the data was very clean and supported the approach that we are taking with use in pregnancy. And these studies have been vetted through the regulatory curve. And we look forward to getting the results and I was confident that we'll be able to get the proper safety profile. It's a very important patient population to help with prevention of HIV. Infection, great. Thanks, Alex. Next question, please. Thank you. And if question comes from Umar Ratford, with Evercore, your mind is opening me after a question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and thank you for all your transparency on the intracellular triphosphate exposures. And that's really where my question was as well. At the six meg dose, it looks like by the end of month one, the PVMC triphosphate levels are almost basically at that efficacy threshold of 03 picomolars. And I'm curious what percentage of the patients that drove that mean were already below that threshold and less so focused on the six meg dose and more so really asking about the 12 meg dose. What percentage of patients I realize mean is above, but what percentage of patients are below the threshold? And secondly, since Murphy's on, and I'm dying to ask him a question, in your view, what percentage of the market by the time you guys launch will be on oral, meaning not on an every four to every six months long acting injection. Thank you very much. So, Umar, thank you. Let me take that the first one. When we do our modeling work to look at the doses that we chose to go into phase three studies, as you know, meat is meat. There's people below, people above. The six milligram dose was good, but we wanted to make sure that it would be covering all different weights, all different potential metabolic profiles and various circumstances, along with a little bit of forgiveness as well. And when you add all of that together, and we did through both our safety and efficacy modeling, the 11 milligram dose got us to the point where we were able to have high confidence that the vast, vast, vast majority would be well above the bottom threshold or what we anticipated to be efficacy. So in that regard, you know, the six milligram dose was pretty good, but we wanted to be able to not just go for meat, but also take the lower most in the distribution of variability and make sure that that lower, you know, 5% were able to get above. And that's why we chose 11. And, you know, 12 was just nearby, but 11 was just good enough for that. And, you know, you always want a little, whatever dose you want, the minimal best effective dose, even if it's the scooch lower than the highest dose that you've tested. Sure thing. Yeah, so Umar, I assume your question is in regards to PrEP, correct? I think he's off. Sorry, so assuming it's in regards to PrEP, so what we do know is that, you know, you have a number, you know, many, many individuals have needle phobia. That's the first consideration, the first insight that I wanted to highlight and reinforce. And the implementation challenges, having to go to a clinic, having to have a nurse inject these meds and so forth. So we anticipate that by the time we come to market with MK8527, there will still be a significant number of people at risk of HIV infection who would be either on Tuvada daily, right? Daily PrEP, or who would want to be on an oral, long-acting option. So the opportunity will be meaningful when we do come to market. Okay, great, thank you. Shirley, any further questions? At this time, I'm showing no further questions. Okay, great, so I want to thank you all for your interest and time this morning. Appreciate you being with us, and please reach out to the IR team if you have any follow-up questions, and we look forward to connecting with you all soon. Thank you so much. Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.
