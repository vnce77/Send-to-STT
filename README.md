It's time for us to start Dr. Eric's room financial announcement for the first quarter of fiscal year ending March 2026. Thank you very much for joining us today, despite your busy schedule. I am Yatsuda of IR Department, serving as a moderator for today's session. Let me introduce today's attendees, Toshiki Kawaii, Representative Director, President and CEO. I am Kawaii, thank you very much. Next, Hiroshi Kawamoto, Senior Vice President and General Manager Division of Finance Division. I am Kawamoto, thank you very much for joining us today. Before starting the presentation, let me explain the flow of today's session. First of all, Kawamoto and Kawaii will make presentations. After the until 6.30 p.m. Japan time, we will have a question and answer session where we entertain questions from the audience. This meeting uses two channels of WebEx for simultaneous interpretation between Japanese and English. As we explained in our email, you are currently requested to use apps on PCs or mobile terminals if you plan to ask questions, but if you are not going to ask questions, you can use telephones. Since this conference is intended for institutional investors and analysts, we would like to appreciate your understanding that we will see questions only from institutional investors and analysts as usual. We will post the audio contents of this conference in Japanese and English on our best site within a couple of days. It would be appreciated if you could also visit site. Now, Mr. Kawamoto will present the consolidated fine summary. Good afternoon, I am Kawamoto finally visioned by the present consolidated financial summary of the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2026. This slide shows the quarter financial summary. I will mean the refer to the figures in the blue box. In the first quarter, we generated net sales of 549.5 billion yen, 16.1% decrease from the previous quarter partially because of temporary posts of customers' capital investments. Gross profit was 253.9 billion yen, 18.2% decline from the previous quarter. Gross profit margin was 46.2%, 1.2% age point drop quarter of a quarter due to the increased ratio of the fixed cost along with the decrease of net sales. Operating income was 144.6 billion yen, 21.3% drop from the previous quarter. Upper and profit margin was 26.3%, declined by 1.7% age point quarter of a quarter, mainly due to the decrease of gross profit margin mentioned before. Inka before Inka taxes decreased by 17.9% to 151.9 billion yen, net income attribute about the owner's apparent was 117.8 billion yen, 17.6% decline from the previous quarter. Capital expenditure in the first quarter were 52.8 billion yen, consisting mainly of the new development building of Tokyo restaurant Miyagi whose construction was completed in April. This is a graphic representation of the financial summary shown on the previous slide on the chronological basis for your reference. This slide shows net sales by region. As for competition in the first quarter, proportion of Japan rose by 3.6% age point to 11.7% quarter of a quarter, while proportion of Korea dropped by 6.3% age point to 16.1% from the previous quarter. Proportion sales in China in the first quarter was 38.6% remaining below 40% following the previous quarter. This shows SP new equipment sales by application. In the first quarter, from the bottom of this chart, sales to no memory customers accounted for 64%, non-vlatanemly accounted for 10%, and DRAM accounted for 26%. Sales to no memory customers were flat from the previous quarter, while proportion of sales to DRAM customers declined by 11% age point quarter over quarter, partly because of their intensive spending in previous quarter. This slide shows the field solution cells. In the first quarter, the solution cells were 141.2 billion yen, growing by 2.2 billion yen, quarter over quarter. Thanks to high utilization rate, mainly for those of the customers' five cells, a part service and modifications were all strong. This slide shows balance sheet. The total asset was 2,509.3 billion yen, cash in cash equivalent was 367.5 billion yen, declining by 128.7 billion yen from the previous quarter, primarily due to dividend payment to shareholders and payment of income taxes. Notes and accounts receivable were 393.2 billion yen, quarter over quarter. Inventories were 7.1 billion yen, increasing by 7.9 billion yen from the previous quarter. Investment and other assets were 400.2 billion yen, increasing by 52.5 billion yen from the previous quarter, mainly because of the increased share price. For the liabilities and net assets shown on the right-hand side, liabilities were 636.5 billion yen, from the previous quarter. This is mainly because of the decrease of income tax payable, along with the payment in income taxes, as I mentioned earlier. Net assets were 1,872.7 billion yen, rising by 7.5 billion yen, quarter over quarter. The equity ratio was 74.0%. This shows cash flow. Infra from operating activities in the first quarter was 74.9 billion yen. The cash-out investment activities was 54.1 billion, mainly due to acquisition of fixed assets. The cash-out from financing activities was 151.1 billion yen, primary because of dividend payment. As a result, free cash flow was positive, 20.1 billion yen. This concludes my presentation. Thank you very much for your kind attention. Now, we will talk about business environment and financial estimates. Tell us some please. Pat, this is Kawaii. Once again, thank you very much for joining us today. I will present business environment and financial estimates. As some changes were observed in the business environment, we have revised WFP market outlook and our financial estimates. Let me start. The revisions made and business progress as well. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, both net sales and profit were almost in line with guidance, progress of strategic product sales and development and variation activities toward pay or acquisition proceeded smoothly. For film deposition 200, a new material, namely low-resistant metal, many non-customers are working on the variation with our batch furnaces. For a series of 3D integration tools, including the extreme laser lift tool released in December 2024, we are currently having business discussion with advanced customers and non-customers. In poor construction of new development building in Miyagi was completed in which we will enhance the development of HRs, one of our main products. Our financial equipment for the last half of fiscal 2026 remain unchanged. Specifically, we expect net sales of 1 trillion, 150 billion yen, operating income of 288 billion yen and operating profit margin of 25.0%. Carla in 2020, WFP market proceeds almost as expected, although there are some shifts in investments. Factoring up of exchange refluxation, the review market is expected to grow slightly from the previous year to $115 billion. The outlook of semiconductor demand remains unchanged. The WFP market in the first half of C by 2026, however, is expected to be affected by changes of customers' investment trends. Specifically, customers now seek for higher productivity through yield enhancement, optimization of supply, demand, balance, to raise profitability and shift from proactive to solid investment. Accordingly, we have revised the outlook of WFP market growth in the fiscal year ending March 2026 to negative 5% year over year. Changes in each segment are shown in this slide. Along with the downward division of the fiscal year-based WFP market outlook, we have revised our FY2026 4-year financial estimate to net sales of 2 trillion, 350 billion yen and operating profit margin of 24.3%. Despite the downward revision, our growth profit is expected to exceed 1 trillion yen for 2 years in a row. Despite the changes of the WFP market outlook from January to June 2026, there is no change at all in powerful growing trend of the semiconductor demand supported by technology driver of AI server applications. Therefore, we plan to invest 295 billion yen to R&D almost as announced three months ago. This shows the revised SPE new equipment sales focus. The SPE new equipment sales in the second half of this fiscal year I expected to grow slightly from the first half to 880 billion yen. Here is the breakdown by application. Please note that this revision is attributed mainly to the customer's investment strategy changes, and therefore it does not necessarily link with the semiconductor demand. As I said before, due to the changes in customer's investment trend, we are currently scrutinizing CI2026 WFP market. Having said that, however, there is no change in our outlook of semiconductor market, which keeps expanding driven by the growing demand of cutting-edge semiconductor plan to be released in calendar 2027 for AI servers. AI servers require high computing power to process massive data at high speed. Currently, two of the four nanometer note GPU are used, but in calendar 2027, four of three nanometer note GPU will be used, and in calendar 2027, each GPU will have 500 billion transistors, about 2.5 times more than the current GPU. The number of HBM will also increase. Memory capacity of HBM will increase by about four times, driven by device scaling of each DRAM, and increase of number of DRAMs to be stuck. So we are finally shift from the gigabyte to a kilobyte era. Investment to realize the next generation AI computing platform is expected to start growing from the second half, second half of CI2026, which device scaling and advanced packaging are business opportunities will be expanding more and more. This shows our plan for R&D expenses, CAPEX. In this fiscal year, following the new development building, in Miyagi Fu's construction was completed in April. Construction of a new development building in Kumamoto and production and logistic center in what it is going to be complete in this coming fall. In Miyagi, we have also started construction of new production building in June, which adopts next generation's manufacturing concept. R&D expenses in fiscal 2026 expected to be 295 billion yen as I said before. The plan for CAPEX and depreciation remains unchanged, expected to be 240 billion yen and 86 billion yen respectively. This is my last slide showing the dividend forecast. Reflecting the revised financial estimate for the second half of this fiscal year, four-year dividend per share is expected to 485 yen in this fiscal year. We are taking account of state of cash on hand and capital efficiency during this fiscal year, where we will effectively consider implementation of share repurchase. This concludes my presentation. Thank you very much for your kind attention. Now we'll have question and succession until 6.30 p.m. Japan time. You can ask questions either in Japanese or English, but our speakers on the Japanese channel, please allow us to take all your questions only in Japanese. If you ask a question in Japanese, please click the raise hand button on WebEx. For details, please refer to the instructions attached to the invitation email. I will invite you one by one. Our secretariat will contact you in advance, so please check WebEx chat box. When asking a question, please, you are kindly requested to unmute your microphone for yourself. When your question is answered by our attendees, please hit the raise button again to remove the raise hand signal. For questions in English, please use WebEx chat box and give you an affiliation, name and question in text and send it to our secretariat. We will be playing floor answering questions if your name and affiliation are not given. On the Japanese channel, we will translate your English question and I will read it out in Japanese and our speakers will speak answered in Japanese. On English channel, the question answer will be simultaneously interpolated into English on a real-time basis. As we would like to take questions from as many participants as possible, we would like to take one question per person. If time allows, we will take additional questions. So the first question from Yoshida Sam from Sheila Sei Securities. I am Yoshida from Sheila Sei Securities. I have a question. 2025, you have revised the WFPE market. I want to see some information by application. So now you are now conservative for the first half of 2026. So based on the peripheral situation, I think the advanced foundry and the run might be increasing, so I was a bit surprised. So once again, so first half you said rather weak, but throughout the year for 2026, I think you said double digit growth. So what happens in the full year? Focused by application and the full market, please. By application, changes are made for logic and foundry. The advanced logic, some of the customers have revised their investment plan for logic and foundry. That's the reason why we have revised our outlook partially. For others, there have been no major changes. However, non-investment gets a bit weaker than expected. However, the non-investment will double. That's what I said before, but the original amount is not so much. Therefore, the changes in non-investment does not have big impact. This is how I let me add some more comments. The customers, now technology is enhanced and they try to review the supply demand balance when they prepare the investment plan. Also, they are shifting from the adhesive proactive investment to the solid investment to enhance the yield, so there are several aspects. So from the first quote, we thought there was some upward trend. However, there have been some deceleration in the customer spendings. So this trend, the demand for semiconductor does not decrease. Therefore, you can see recovery sometime in the future. From maybe the first six months, next calendar might be some correction period. However, as I said earlier, now new technologies for AI server will be released in the second half of 2027. Therefore, from the second half of 2026 to the early 2027, we think the customers' capex will be increasing. That's how we view the market trend. In that sense, I thought double-digit growth is expected, but the first half of next year will see some deceleration, but we have a station for the increasing trend in the second half of the year. We are now scrutinizing addition, but we think the positive growth is expected. So the advanced logic and logic, the proportion is about 50% to 50% for this year. Next year should be 60% to 40%. How we view the proportion? Thank you very much. Let me get some clarification. 2026, calendar year 2026. Although this is positive growth, now revising the figure, scrutinizing figures, therefore you will give us more. When you said proportion between the advanced and logic, are you talking about the proportion between the advanced and mature node? This year, 50 to 50, but next year, the proportion will become 60 to 40%. That's correct. 2027, we can see new technology for AI server. As I said earlier in my presentation, that would be a driver. That's one thing. Also, now DDR4 and DDR5 price has been reversed, because there are corrections in the market. DDR5, become a driver to further draw out in the AI markets. AI technology MPU will be introduced in the ice water piece by 30% as well. So these are the technology drivers, which will have the big impact from 2026 to the early 2027. So customers' enhancement of technology for production, and they are focusing on profitability. So they do have now healthy growth plan because of that. There are some desolation in the investment plan, but by on launch, there might be the delay of six months, and that six months delay has been incorporated. And there have been changes in the ice market, and I think this will be growing as expected. Thank you very much. That's very clear. Mr. Yoshida, thank you very much for your question. Next question is from the Wajaki, the Morgan Stanley UFG Securities, Research Japan. First of all, about the downward revision, I think it's a kind of plateau. So I understand the downward revision. I have a question regarding China. In general, in your company, so companies on entity list will not be conducted at all. Or as for you don't sell HR or some products, but you are selling other products to the customers, Chinese customers on entity list. Could you explain the situation, please? Our company is not affected by the entity list. We are shipping the tools approved by the Japanese government, Métis. So we are following the Métis policy. So your company, products, for example, the products on the entity list, how much percentage of your products are related to the entity list, and how much percentage are not related to the entity. More critical equipment are to be regulated. That's the natural trend. Therefore, it's not the volume base or month base. It's a bit difficult to say. But to some extent, there are some equipment. We are not to ship over the past few years. But clear fears or numbers cannot be disclosed. In this meeting. So we are following Métis policy and Métis rule. So now the revision of financial estimate is not attributed to the export control. So what about more than 50% or less than 50%. The way below 50%. So more than 10% of your products are affected by the regulations. We haven't calculated the percentage. I'm sorry for that. Thank you very much. Mr. Wadhaki, thank you very much for your question. Next question is from Mr. Nakamura of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Nakamura, please. Thank you very much. This is Nakamura. Thank you. So the second half of your fiscal year. Now you have made the downward revision. I want to know more about that downward division. WFP market for college 2025. So many changes. But you have revised your outlook downward. That means in the market, your maximum declining is about to mean or they're having drastic change for the outlook of January to March 2026 over the past three months. On page 13, you can see several factors related to the downward revision. So when you quantify those factors, which factor plays the major role? If the customer's productivity goes up, even if the semiconductor market will glow, I'm afraid the SP industry cannot enjoy good business. Could you explain those things, please? First of all, could you repeat your first question once again, please? Okay. The current 2025, WFP market does not change so much while your financial estimate has been revised downward. Why does it happen? Thank you very much. This time, WFP market on the current databases should be $115 billion. So the WFP market outlook is increased. But because of the exchange rate, the equipment produced in Japan, when they are calculated on the dollar basis, actually increased by $3 billion. The remaining $2 billion is coming from the leading age logic. Pulled in investment together with other reasons. That's the reason why we have increased the WFP market outlook by $5 billion. As for your second question, what you say is correct. So the fourth quarter, we think from January to March next fiscal year, we thought we can see increasing growth from January to March 2026. That's our previous focus. Because of the changes in the customer strategy, they are trying to improve productivity and they try to focus on productivity now. That's actually our outlook has been revised downward. So impacts are shown on page 13. You ask me, quantify those factors. That's what you said in your question. There are five factors on page 13. The customer's investment revision for advanced logic. The reduction of the legacy investment by numerous customers, Chinese customers, and investment plan change because of the focusing on the productivity and DDR4 and DDR5. So this is the order from the top towards the bottom. I think this is the order of the impact. Especially three has the major impacts. When it comes to China, the emerging semiconductor manufacturers in China, there is about 2 billion on the basis of fiscal year. The impact is about 2 billion. So the Chinese emerging customers may be data about 150 chip makers in China, and that 150 Chinese chip makers are getting a little bit conservative. And when we accumulate the figures, that is amounted to $2 billion. So five factors and the top measure, one measure, primary, there are three major reasons on top for our downward revision. Thank you very much for your detailed explanation. Mr Nakamura, thank you very much for your question. Next question is from Shimamoto-san from Oka-san Securities. Thank you very much. I am Shimamoto from Oka-san Securities. Thank you very much. I have some visions for figures. The very simple question. CUI, WFE. Color in 2025, WFE market used at $115 billion. This is the upward revision. On the FY basis, also on the dollar basis, the minus or negative 5% is expected. Compared to this previous year, 5% increase on this current data basis but minus 5% on the fiscal year basis. So three months difference makes that big difference. That's correct. So that's because of the outlook from January to March. Next year has been directly changes. Yes, we thought you can see some increasing trend from January to March. And we thought we need to do some preparation because in the technology driver, we were expecting increasing trend from January to March. However, there is only actually the decreasing trend from January to March. The fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we were calling the year January to March. WFE market trend has been shifted over the start. So the WFE market will increase. But actually now it's a device to downward. When it comes to share, our share in the sum has been secured. Therefore, this is not negative or downward division because of the decline in share. Each company made the own announcement. The timing of delivery was to miss our reasons. Therefore, our share is not declined. I want to add this comment. Sorry, I answered to the previous question as well. Very much. Thank you very much. I have one question. When you look at four year basis, there is a possibility for positive growth. That's what you said. But some projects have been pushed out. Is that how you view the market trend or some projects? Some investment are accounts. How do you view the market equation? The semiconductor demand is expected to grow toward next year. And that outlook hasn't changed at all. We have revised downward revision. So one of the reasons is the customers' approach to enhance productivity by improving yield. And customers wear a probability by balancing supply, demand, effectively. And they try to shift from proactive, aggressive investment to the solid investment, especially among logic customers. So these are the major changes from our original or previous outlook. When it comes to investments project, there have been no translation at all. So maybe the delay should be six months at maximum. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your question, Mr. Shimamoto. Next question is Mr. Yamamoto of Mizzou Securities. I am Yamamoto from Mizzou Securities. Can you hear me? Yes. Thank you. I have very many questions. Sorry for that. So six months delay, you refer to. But as for your company, the first half and second half sells by application. Could you give us some more information regarding the sales, the first and second half by application? You can see some declining figures, but actually did themselves from the first and second half. Your sales were increasing. And not sales, you expect to address the increase from the first and second half. Actually, you decline no memory. There is some increase from the first half, but actually the memory of the sales remained flat. So maybe for none, this relation is a major factor. You set on page 13. You set the first three are the major factors. And I think that none is the number three factor. Actually, when you look at figures, they are almost the same. But the change rate for none is rather big, significant. So could you explain the figures, please? I think there are some specific issues for Tokyo restaurant. So could you refer to page 15, please? Could you refer to page 15? On the left, you can see the sales by application for the second half of this fiscal year. The 880 billion on the right, you can see our announcement in April. The estimate announced April 1,100 billion yen. And the height of the bar chart, the change of the height of bar chart, represents the changes or revision of our outlook. The green portion, back in April, the height of green bars. When you refer to the left-hand side, the second half of this fiscal year, there is no change in proportion. However, height of the green bar is decreased because of the changes of the strategy by some logic customers. The note, you can see reduction of purple portion, 15% back in April. However, now we expect an 11% age. So you can see height of the purple portion. That represents the amount. You can see the data of the previous fiscal year. As you can see, the height of purple is more than last year. When you look at this fiscal year's purple portion. So supply demand balance for NAND is well closely watched by NAND customer and NAND customer conducted some adjustment. And we have incorporated the adjustment made by the NAND customers. The first half of next year is a kind of correction period. So there is some difference in between calendar and fiscal year, but your company's new equipment application sales might be reduced in the first half of next fiscal year. Is that correct understanding? Actually, toward two nanometer note, the customer investment plan, not only one company, I think more customers will present their investment plan toward two nanometer note. So you want to closely watch the situation. It's so difficult to find that right timing. Thank you very much. Mr. Yamamoto, thank you very much for your question. Next question is from Kamisak-san from Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory. I am Kamisak from Tokyo. I have a question regarding emerging Chinese chip numbers. WFP market assumption on calendar 2025, second half of calendar 2025, I think their investment is getting weaker. So for the first half of calendar 2026, do you think the further reduction is expected in the first half of the calendar 26 among the Chinese emerging chip makers? So annually, that's about 45 to 46 billion. I think that's the trend toward 2026. The legacy note market and the number of chip makers in China is rather big. There are so many emerging Chinese chip makers. I don't know the average. It's a bit difficult for me to give you the answer. But the WFP in China, this year of 45 or 6 billion dollars, I think the size of the revenue market remains unchanged. However, the entire WFP market is going up. Therefore, the proportion of legacy will be declining next calendar year. So for the new foundries, the yield has been improving. Now you can see more and more new foundries. Do you think so? Or do you don't see any new emerging countries? So far, there is no such trend. If the emerging chip makers yield is improving. So the price and service sales are expected to increase because the utilization rate goes up. However, so far we haven't seen such kind of trend. Thank you very much. Kind of like some. Thank you very much for your question. The next question is given in English text. So let me read it out. The question is from Tammy Keesan. We are in about asset management. The question is, was a growth driver for second half, 2026 regarding acceleration, please? Then is your 2026 WFP estimation still unchanged? Also on China, has China spending bottomed after scaling back you have been seeing? Or can it go down further? The three questions. As for your first question, the growth driver is AI server applications, the leading edge logic for AI server and HBM. When you refer to page 16 of the slide, as I said on page 16 of the slide of present, the current device for AI server, four nanometer, two of the four nanometer load GPU are mounted right now. But in the future, three nanometer node GPU, four of them actually will be mounted in the future. In calendar 2027, now there are 200 billion transistors right now. However, in 2027, two years from now, the hybrid billion transistors will be mounted as for HBM present. There are eight HBM's for two GPU to generate the memory capacity of 288 gigabyte. But in year 2027, the memory capacity will increase to one terabyte, the 16 DRAM size to be stocked. And the number of layers will be increasing from 12 to 16. So these are the major driver. What was the second question? Yes, the second question is, is your 2026 WFE estimation still unchanged? So 2026 WFE market outlook is under investigation right now. There is some delay from January to March 2026 per second quarter from April to June 2026 when we can see some early trend. So we are now scrutinizing WFE market trend in calendar 2026. And we are now scrutinizing the situation. But anyway, 2027, you can see the study increasing in simple AI server. And I think the preparation for such new innovation will start from the second half of the 2026 WFE market is expected to grow in later 2026. We want to analyze the situation more to come up with something more clear. The third question is regarding China. From last year to this year, so WFE market in China has been shrinking. Do you think the Chinese WFE market bottomed out? Or do you see some more decline in WFE market for DX and GX and semiconductor demand for digital transformation and wind transportation will be increasing steadily? And the Chinese customers' self-sufficiency in China is not yet fulfilled in Chinese market. And at present, there are some struggle in power semiconductors. I think Chinese proportion is in the middle of the 30% level when WFE goes up. When it comes to a month, Chinese market is also expected to grow. So we don't see further decline in Chinese WFE market in the future. Thank you very much for your question. Next question is from Yoshio Ka Sam from Nomura Securities. Thank you very much. I am Yoshio Ka from Nomura Securities. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. So WFE market and tail growth potential. This is what I want to ask. First of all, FY26 or fiscal year ending March 2026. Now you have made the downward revision minus 5%. What was the figure three months ago announcement? And after that, after you tell me, what about this fiscal year? You said that Tokyo restaurant sales will decrease by 3%. That means your company outperformed the WFE market. But when it comes to the fiscal 2027, do you think you can outperform WFE market? Are there any difference between tail growth and WFE market trend? So our mid-term management plan, 2027 is a target year of our mid-term management plan and product mix and timing of delivery. So there is not consistent trend. But when it comes to our earning power, our company's earning power is getting stronger and stronger. So Gautna made announcement April this year for the share. When it comes to WFE market, the calendar year, the growth rate is 5.6%. And our company's growth rate was 23%. Therefore, especially our H sales increased and COTA developer share is increased from 90% and father higher. And 3D in relation, Bonda deep wonder, actually ourselves of Bonda, the Bonda has been increased by three times over the past two years. So our earning power is getting stronger, steadily. Because of that, five years ago, our growth profit margin was 40%. But recently, our growth profit margin has increased by about 5% point. So the growth profit is exceeding one trillion yen for two years in a row. Needless to say, regulations have some impact. The high value added product cannot be delivered to Chinese market as well as sunsetting his question. And geopolitical impacts and inflation impacts are also observed. But our growth profit exceeds one trillion yen for two years in a row. And our growth profit margin has increased by 5% point over the past five years. And our share has been increasing. So our share and profit growth, both of those two factors, are improving steadily, despite of the geopolitical factors. And next fiscal year, we will closely see whether we can achieve those figures, but it is clear that our earning power is improving steady. Also, ROE, 30% or more. Last year, we achieved 30.3% ROE. So we achieved our midterm management goal two years ahead of the target here. So if the sales come back, we are able to achieve the figures or targets of midterm management plan sometime in the future. And midterm management plan is not the final goal. So it's a kind of interim goal for us. So on the FY basis, we happen to disclose information as the WFP market on FFP. So thank you very much. So FY2027. WFP market growth and tokens sales are almost comparable. Yes, of course, we won't be below the WFP market growth in fiscal 2027. I think we cannot perform WFP market also in the fiscal 2027. Thank you very much. Mr. Yoshio Kaku, your question. Next question is Mr. Nakano Mio of Japanese, Japan. Thank you very much. On page 13, I'm sorry, repeat the same question once again. I try to prove my understanding. So some leading edge logic customers are revising their CAPX plan. So you may not be able to talk about specific customer. When you have three major customers, originally two logic customers didn't change their investment so much. In that sense, the active investment made by only one logic customer and the particular logic customer has changed their investment plan for January to March 2027. Or do you think the other two logic customers' investment plan will be deferred further more? It's a bit difficult to make the comment. I think your second option is more likely. So the capital efficiency improves for the one major logic customer. And your business is rather getting smaller. No, that doesn't happen. And January to March next year, it's six months ahead. And now you have revised your outlook. That means the changes in January to March is rather clear or realistic. So now, various customers and some top management have been changed. The new top management issue, the new policy or direction. And some customers' financial announcements are made. And we have incorporated all those factors for HBM, HBM investment. And again, the CAPX investment efficiency gets better. And investment for HBM is not increasing so much. Was scaling of DDR5 improves investment efficiency? Well, only the matter of timing of investment. So, semiconductor demand itself is growing. And toward year 2030, the semiconductor market is expected to grow to $1,000,000. There is no change at all for this major trend. For 2027, the new device for server will be spreading further more. So, there is no change in the growing trend of semiconductor market or demand. So, in that sense, there have been no changes compared with the previous guide outlook. But customers' technology production technology is improved. Because of that, some revisions were made. Our short-time financial estimate has been revised downward. And that portion has the negative impacts. However, on the other hand, the investment. Actually, customers have closely watched supply demand balance. And customers are more focusing on profitability. And they try to improve productivity. And they are improving their yield. So, they can produce chips with low cost. So, now for long-term perspective, these factors have positive impact to further drive the growth. In mid- and longer-term perspective, because of the technology innovation. So, as for the financial estimates, maybe we might have some impact for six months. And there are some symptoms, and we try to address to the capital market properly. And because we are, we become aware of this kind of trend, we decided to make a disannouncement. Thank you very much for your question, Mr. Nagano. Any question is Mr. Shibano of City Group Global Markets Japan. Thank you very much for your presentation. I am Shibano of City Group Global Markets Japan. For the quarterly performance improvement or momentum for the further improvement of your financial performance. So, the quarterly sales, the fourth quarter should be the bottom. Is that correct understanding? And when it comes, there is no quantitative disclosure, I understand that. When it comes to qualitative manner, in terms of orders, do you see some decrease in trend in orders? Let's say the July-September period should be the bottom period. Is that correct understanding? So, the bottom period, we should investigate to scrutinize further more. I think January-March period is very close to the bottom. We should study more to see what will happen in June. That might be some delay by three months or six months. But in the second half of 2027, we will see a new device for AI server. When you think about that new device, there is a possibility to have the sudden increase or growth in the market. So, we also need to watch the enhancement of customers yield. Thank you very much. You talked about mid-term management plan. When you answer to the question of Mr. Yoshioka, I have one follow-up question. FY2027 is the target year of mid-term management plan. So, six months ago, maybe you said you can achieve the net sales of three trillion yen. And do you think there are some changes in that prospect or external environment has been changed over the past three years? And not only the most recent changes, but I think overall trend has been changed. So, would you like to refresh your ground targets? Or you don't think there is no need to revise the mid-term management plan? When it comes, I think the approach to the fixed cost and the investment has been changed. How do you view the current management plan? As I said a little bit earlier, so now you can see improvement of the gross profit margin and our share has been improving. And new products, process of record, POR, or qualification by the customer has been acquired. So, there are quite a few good positive factors because of that. So, now there is a kind of delay by six months and we try to find out the magnitude of impacts. But for mid-term management plan, maybe fiscal 2027 or 2028, ever since the announcement of our current mid-term management plan, there have been many changes in terms of geopolitics. We are making steady progress in our business and we are keeping the investment for further growth in the future. And there is high expectation for further technology innovation. Therefore, we have no intention to revise our mid-term management plan. The only thing is the timing for achievement of mid-term management plan, which will be affected by WV market trend to some extent. But when WV market reaches a certain level, we are sure to achieve the targets. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Your question. Actually, one more question. The question is from Varun Lajawansi from Lazad Aziz Management. The question is, can you please make a comment on your market share, including China? Are there areas where it is in jail? Your sales outlook for this fiscal year is much worse, as is what peers are suggesting. First of all, among different applications, the leading edge area, we don't lose shares in advanced areas. Partially, in China, the general purpose will legacy node devices. Because of the Chinese government policy, the Chinese two vendors are improving their share. That's true. Last year, WV market analysis announced by Gartner. The WV market grew by 5.7% on average. It took an extra degree by more than 23%. Despite weak hand, the growth rate of 23% or more is very outstanding. Actually, three Chinese companies among the top 20, and some of their sales growth rate is more than 40%. In the Chinese legacy market, our share in the Chinese legacy market has been declining slightly. However, when it comes to the volume zone for our further growth, that is cutting edge technology area, we keep our share. Compared with our peers, there might be some strong negative impacts. Some companies may have stronger figures for share in this year. That is because of product mix and the timing of delivery. But in our existing markets, we don't lose our market share at all in the leading edge area. Thank you very much for your question. So, it is simple as to close today's conference. Before closing, however, I'd like to make an announcement. Semicon West will be held in Phoenix, Arizona, for three days from October 7th to 9th, 2025. On day one, October 7th, Tokyo restaurant will organize fire side chart from one o'clock. Joined by Mr. Kawai, Mr. Akiyama, Mr. Ishida and Mr. Sikhi Gucci. In this event, we plan to discuss our midterm and long-term business opportunities and rose potential. If you go to Semicon West, please join us in this event. We will send you the details later. And lastly, we'd like to continue to improve our IIR activities based on your precious feedback. So, we would like to appreciate your kind cooperation in filling out the questionnaire before you exit the webex.
