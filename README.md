Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I am Costantino Jercors' co-operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Motor All Conference Call and Live webcast to present and discuss the first half-2024 financial results. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Pedro Tannetakis, Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Ms. Merip Sillaki, Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Tannetakis, you may now proceed. Good morning, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, to all of you, from all of us here. We are three, four, five, and another five, 12 people in the room, so I'm in good company. Half year 2024 and Q2 2024 results. Slide five, some highlights. We delivered the strong operating profitability in the second quarter and the first half of the year. Of course, it was an easy comparison to last, compared to last year when we had completed the major scheduled maintenance in the refinery. Half year it would be Dar of 639 million euros, increased by 19% year-on-year and net income of 359, increased 30% year-on-year. We achieved this performance despite the 10% drop in our refining margins during the period at the review. Net debt stood at 1.6 billion, returning to the level of year end 2023, thanks to a strong cash flow generation during the second quarter. Please note that this was something that had concerned us in the results of the first quarter, when the parent company debt had gone to 803 million euros from 425 at the end of the year. And we are pleased to say that at the end of the second quarter, it was down to 423. So as the indication which we had given you at the time, we were in a good track, indeed, was achieved. Slide six, we see the different segments. Adjusted numbers were only slightly lower than the reported ones due to a small inventory gain, included in the numbers for the first half of the year. A small inventory loss of 5 million in Q2 was partially offset, partially offset the inventory gain of Q1, leading to a gain of 15 million for the first half. So adjusted to be thus, stood at 289 in Q2, net profit at 172 million from 155 and 52 million respectively. The refining segment adjusted to be that climb to 231 in the second quarter from 89 a year ago, mainly due to lack of maintenance activity. Fures marketing to be that was also strong, year on year, reaching 30 million in the second quarter. Power and gas to be that was 27 million from 40 million a year ago due mainly to a reclassification that would be explained in a later stage when we analyze the specifics. Slide eight, the different indicators, the price of Brent was barely unchanged, Q and Q, in the second quarter, 87 dollars per barrel at the end of June, 85 on average in Q2, indicating a rather balanced market despite short-term volatility from escalating geopolitical tensions. At an average of 1.077 in Q2, 24, the dollar strengthened by a very small one percent, quarter and quarter, any year on year. Middle distillate cracks, weak and further in the second quarter, as a result of dial industrial demand and increased imports from Middle East and Asia. However, on the other hand, gasoline and high sulfur fuel oil cracks continue to strengthen them. Moving to levels close to the, moving to levels close to the same quarter of last year, gasoline cracks reached 18.8 barrels, dollars per barrel on average in the second quarter, thanks to resilient demand in Europe and seasonally low inventories. High sulfur fuel oil cracks stood at an average of minus 11.7, dollars per barrel in the second quarter, as a result of continued supply restrictions by OPEC. And really, if you see these sort of differences between the products, how gasoline performed compared to diesel and how fuel oil also performed, it does explain to a certain extent why we managed to have a good refinery margin in the second quarter, because the mix of our products was slightly different to the mix of our products in the first quarter and the products of which we sold more, which we will see in a while, were the ones with a better cracks. The discount of Basra medium to Brent remained unchanged, Q and Q, standing at an average of minus 4.8 dollars per barrel in the second quarter, implying unchanged conditions in the availability of heavy crude foils. Let's move to slide 9, fuels marketing, domestic market. We are seeing this per market, fuels market in Greece continued to grow in the second quarter, civil by one and a half percent, year on year, shipping aviation by 4%, 4.7%, total market by 3.4%, this solid performance indicates healthy conditions in the domestic market, supported by strong tourism and July numbers, which were released last week, point to the same direction. The tourist season in Greece has been very sort of good, very strong. Slide 10, fuels marketing the domestic consumption, looking at specific products, gasoline sales were up, 1.4% in the second quarter and 2.1% in the first half, auto diesel up 4.7% and 4.6% respectively, LPG sales were slightly down by flat in the quarter, but flatish in the first half and jet continued to deliver fast growth in the second quarter of 17% reflecting Greece's strong tourism season. Bank of fuel oil and diesel were down by 2.5% in the second quarter, but they remained in positive territory for the first half with a growth rate of 2.6%. Moving to slide 11, power and gas, gas prices increased from an average of 28 euros per megabatt hour in the first quarter to 32 in the second quarter, so it's a 14% increase, but they remained below last year's level by around 9%, as a result of sufficient inventory levels. At the end of June, European gas storage was 77% full, 10% at points above the 5-year average. The market is well supplied, but the TTF rally reflects fears of supply shops in the coming winter, and this illustrates how sensitive the market remains to any tightening risks into this winter. Prices of EUAs also increased Q and Q to 70 euros per metric ton from 61, but remained well below last year's level by about 21%. In line with gas and EUAs, price trends, the wholesale electricity price increased rose to an average of 80 euros per megabatt hour in the second quarter from 78 in the first quarter and 106 in the second quarter last year. Greek electricity production increased by 26% in the second quarter, with renewables accounting for 51% of total generation. Looking at the next slide, slide 13, where we have half one numbers, you can see the different segments, so at the top part of the table, we have the half one of 24 at the bottom, the half one of 23. We see the refinery with strong profitability, it helped, of course, by the easy comparison to last year when we completed the major maintenance of the refinery, but still very positive numbers. Fuels marketing also continued a good performance in the second quarter. Power and gas increased the bidar for the renewables business, but was upset by normalised performance of energy, and we can clearly see this with a bottom for the last year. Slide 14, we go into the detailed segments one by one, a refining segment, performance in Q2 adjusted the bidar of 231, you can see it on the second column, and 494 the fourth column for the first half, compared to 89 for Q2 23 and 473 respectively for the year before. The strong performance was driven by increased production and sales, and a favourable comparison to last year when we completed the big turnaround in the refinery. Moving to the next slide, slide 15, we see the process volume and the crude mix, the total process volume, obviously increased by 40% to 6.5 million metric tons in the first half, the small two bars in the middle of the page, with crude processing up by 42%, while other fixed stock was down due to an availability by 39%. Crude utilisation in the second quarter reached 208,000 bars per day, from a low 118 a year ago, of course, before and because of the maintenance. For the first half of the year, utilisation reached 210,000 bars per day, from 149 bars a year ago. So clearly, this number of 210, 208, 212 is the new reality of the operating mode of motor oil. The mix of crude used was similar to private periods, Iraqi crude, accounted for 75%, followed by grades from Libya 15, Kazakhstan 9, and the North Sea 2%. Coming to slide 16, we see what I touched briefly before, which has to do with production in yields, total production reached 6, 6.1 million metric tons in the first half increased by 14%. Product mix was similar to last year, with a slightly shuffling in the middle distance category, with more jet and less diesel, reflecting market trends, but gasoline production remains very strong, accounting for 21% of total production, and we can see this on the bottom right graph, which shows exactly that gasoline is one of the best performance performance in the refinery. Slide 17 shows the sales, the volumes increased by 11%, in the first half to 6.7, all markets did well, domestic market was up by 23% in the first half, exports by 8%, shipping aviation by 13%. At the country mix, the graph on the top right, the Greece civil accounted for 26% of total revenues, with shipping and aviation, complementing the country's remaining 10%. So clearly, this strong demand in Greece, mainly because of tourism, of jet and automotive fuels, is helping the overall sales. Slide 18, we have the table of margins, the decrease Q and Q, as a result of we committed this to the cracks, that more than upset the stronger gasoline and high salt of fuel oil cracks during the quarter. Our adjusted margin stood at 107, dollars per metric ton, you can see it at the very right of the table, in Q2, slightly lower than Q1, and above last year's Q2, yes, for obvious reasons, for half one, our margin stands at 109, dollars per metric ton, from 134 in the full year of 2023, our performance to the benchmark remains above $20 per metric ton. Slide 19, fuels marketing, the sales volumes were up during the first half by 7% increase, our market shares remain intact and business performance continued to improve during the second quarter, both increase and abroad. The segment CBDA stood at 52 million euros in the first half compared to 22 of last year. Slide 20, power and gas segment, it would be down to 75, in the first half from 93 in the same period last year, solely due to a weaker performance of energy after the very high half of 23, and our GZBDA narrowed to 12 and a half million in the first half of the year from 39 million a year ago due to low margins in a more normalized and competitive market. Energy's electricity market share stood at 5.6 at the end of June from 5.4 a year earlier. The number of public EV charging points reached 1453 from 1021 a year ago. More operating capacity was 839 megawatts, we can see this in the right hand side of the table, at the end of June from 772 megawatts a year earlier and unchanged versus Q3. Production increased by 21% Q and Q and by 17% year on year in the first half. The DOW of more our renewable business reached 63 million in the first half from 54 million a year ago, so clearly we see an increase here. This year on year improvement is a result of the higher load factors and the addition of 67 megawatts in the fourth quarter of 23. Please note that load factors are seasonally lower in the second quarter versus the first quarter which also partially explains the lower EVDA Q and Q. Also note that we proceeded with the reclassification of an income item from above EVDA in Q1 to below EVDA in Q2 which led to Q2 EVDA looking much lower than Q1 but this is not representative of the business performance clearly. First half numbers are comparable and show the healthy growth of our renewable business. Slide 22. Group P&L, EVDA on the right hand side column for the group 639 in the first half, 19% above last year's level of 535. Below the VDA line we highlight the lower net financial cost as a result of a gain from derivatives as well as lower net financial costs excluding of course the derivatives impact. Furthermore income from associates is a negative number due to the reduction of the investment in a lactor following the partial exercise of the put option by Regeborg. Fast earnings after tax and minorities rose by 30% year-on-year faster than EVDA reaching 359 million euros in the first half. Turning page looking at the balance sheet as we said earlier on a much strengthened picture net debt decreased by 400 million during the second quarter for the group standing at 1.5 billion at the end of June. In line with our previous communication cash flow improves significantly during this quarter with three cash flow generation reaching 416 million supported by strong EVDA of 284 and working capital in flow of 221 million euros. We remind you that half one includes the payment of 123.5 million euros for the acquisition of the remaining 25% in animals renewables. Slide 26, Capix reached 82 million for the company and 123 for the group. For the time being we maintain our previous guidance for the full year. As our remaining investment projects remain stay in on course and in line with our previous communication. That maturity profile group debt remained almost unchanged at the end of the half year compared to the end of 23 at 2.6 billion. The improvement in net debt during the second quarter resulted from better cash flow generation. A balance sheet remains very strong with net debt at 1.1 times EVDA of the last 12 months. And an interesting point to know that our average weighted average cost of debt was 4.05 percent at the end of June 24 from 4.4 percent at the end of 2023. Coming to the end of the presentation we want to sort of mention a little bit what's the current environment. Refining margins are lower quarter on quarter in line with industry trends due to lower cracks for light and middle distillates products and tighter crude differential. Production however is strong with capacity utilization standing at over 210,000 miles so far in the third quarter and both fuels marketing and powering gas performance is healthy. A few additional developments which we have to mention the electric option by Regeberg to buy back part of the shares happened to place in June. 10.4 shares at 175 shares total of 18 million. So this is roughly 3% of the shares we own at ELACTO. So now from just under 30 we have fallen to just under 27%. The remaining options correspond to 15.5 million shares which are going to be exercised later. The July EGM approved the acquisition of ELACTO from ELACTO. This is the waste management business. We currently anticipate the approval of the competition authority and we hope that this will happen in the last quarter of the year. So we hope that by the end of the year the transaction will close and I remind you the cost was the agreed cost is 114.7 million euros for 94.4 of the share capital. Also in July we had a capital return from ELACTO. We collected a capital return of half a euro per share for the shares we own which are 93.6 million shares totaling 46.8 million euros. And last but not least as a lot has been written and said during this past few days about a ship that was passing through the straits of swears carrying crude to be delivered at i.e. the ordinary so indeed this is a cargo that is being transported to the motor refinery. We are glad that after several countries had put a lot of international pressure because the risk of having a ship in the middle engine is quite important and so the Yemen Sufi group agreed to allow tugboats and rescueships to reach the crew tank and the Red Sea. So we are happy that this seems to have been resolved or at least is progressing well and that international sort of sanity and politics and negotiations bear had a good result. I will stop here and give the floor to you with your questions. Thank you for listening. The first question comes from the line of Kishmaria and now with UBS. Please go ahead. Good day. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have several questions if I may. First probably will be on the outlook. We see a sharp drop in refining margins over the last few weeks. Can you please comment on what do you see for the second half? How does it shape up in Greece and what can you comment on the outlook if possible? Second question would be on working capital. In line with your comments from first quarter we saw a partial working capital build reversal. What should be expected in second half? Can we see some more of the working capital release? And finally regarding this option exercise on electors chairs, do you have any timeline for the remaining option to be exercised? Should we expect it happening this year as well? Thank you very much. Anna, hello. Good to hear you. Difficult questions. So we do see a drop of the margins even though July kept well. So the July numbers up to the beginning of August were pretty decent. We have seen this tightness in August. We are however optimistic that usually tightness also brings reaction and when refineries that are less complex have low refinery margins, they usually reduce their production because they are losing money and we have seen this cycle happening. So we believe and hope that we will see this again. After all, our horizon is always longer than a month or a quarter. So let's look at the third quarter and then at the fourth quarter believing that the market will sort of normalize again. Working capital, we have some dividends coming from optima which is about three million. We have 18.2 million from the sale of the electors chairs which came in July. We have the 46.8 million from the electors' capital return which also came from July in July. But of course we had the outflow of the 115 million for the final dividend which was paid in July. So I would say sort of a balanced picture. It is a little bit premature to tell you how things are looking with the end of September. Even though sales are keeping up and they are good and there is no particular reason to increase the working capital. Of course if there is a delay with the arrival of the cargo because all these sort of actions to bring the cargo to current I guess will take some time. Nobody knows exactly how much. There might be a delay and probably this cargo will be out of cash flow situation in September. But nothing dramatic. We don't see any big shift. Okay so it's fine tuning. Now with the lactor our understanding, even though it's not an official sort of position, it's our understanding as the shares that Regeborg exercised was partially, and it was representing 2.90%, 2.97% out of a total of roughly 10% there, 7.5, sorry, 7.5. What is this magic number of 2.9%? There is a rule in the capital markets by the capital markets committee that if a transaction of more than 3% in a share takes place, then the buyer of the shares has the obligation to do a public tender. So by buying less than 3%, Regeborg avoids doing the public tender, which obviously is unnecessary and nobody wants it. Since they bought these shares in June, and the law allows you 6 months to elapsed until you can again buy roughly 3%, this takes us to December or January to be on the safe side. So purely my guesstimate is that the next sort of under 3% should happen roughly 6 months after the first. And of course the last one and a half, 1.6% remaining will again happen in the middle of next year. That's it. Thank you very much. The next question comes from the land of Resender Ricardo with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the CapEx. If you look at the balance compared to what you have deployed in the first half with the guidance for the year, how should you think about the breakdown on the fourth quarter if there is any more concentration on a given quarter? And then the second question, when you look at the situation in Libya, some talks of production there have been potentially halted. Have you been noticing any impact on your crude sourcing and how would you be able to offset any implications on your source from Libya? Thank you. Hello, and it's very good to have you on the call since you're not covering the company as well. So, CapEx, I don't have an answer to the breakdown by quarter because it's almost outside our hands. It's the progress of the progress of the different projects in the refinery and how the payments happen. I would guess that it is sort of equally spread. But what we will, let's say, have a better view at the conference call of the nine months' results because then we will have much better visibility in order to adjust the number for the year and its adjustment. With Libya, yes, it is true that this will create some potential tightness because we have been buying from Libya. But we have already alternative routes or analytic sources. And so the plan that we have and actually I have it in front of me has already adjusted to both this one cargo that will be delayed and to a lack of Libyan cargo for a while. So, yes, we have alternative. I don't want to go into detail, but we do have alternative cargo to keep the refinery running, you know, flat out. That is very clear, Patras. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Alana Fatana. So, yes, Nick, goes with your own equities. Please go ahead. Hello, a few short questions on my side. First of all, regarding the field stock and availability of other fields, I mean, that you mentioned both in this call and in the previous quarter call, how is this going currently and how do you see it developing towards the end of the year? Also, regarding the solid tax contribution, I think that you mentioned or you stated in your financial results that your estimate is about $205 million. When do you expect this figure to finalize? And finally, regarding the field's marketing activity, do you have an update regarding the cap on profitability, where this has been amended given that the activities performing better this year? Thank you. Yup. The feed stock, the third feed stock is doing better than it used to and actually, the availability in the second quarter has been the highest of the past quarters. And so, things are looking a little bit better in this quarter as well. So, there is some, some, let's say, optimism. Solidarity tax, the number that we tentatively put in the financial statements will be finalized at the end of September with the filing of the tax return by the 30th of 98 to 205. We put the maximum possible number there out of B, you know, in order to be conservative. The likelihood is that it might be a little bit lower than this, but this is the magnitude. Feels marketing. The cap is still in place, but overall demand has been good. And I guess also, the mix of products has been good and has been affected by tourism. And don't forget that when we talk about the second and the third quarter for the Feels marketing companies, the mix of sales is much more in favor of higher margin products, you know, like gasoline, diesel, and of course, jet. The numbers, let me quickly look at my tables, the numbers that some of which I mentioned before, in the, in the, the, purely the mix in the second quarter, we had gasoline up 1.4%, automotive diesel up 4.7%. So, there is, and there is no, there is no heating, because heating, which is also being sold by the, you know, local fuel companies, has a much lower margin. So, definitely the margin of the second quarter and the third is a more favorable for the fuel marketing companies. But the guilt is still in place. Yeah. Thank you. The next question comes from a line of COYAS facilities, but the lack of security is, please go ahead. Hello, and congratulations for a robust set of results. I have three questions. My first question is about the, the stake in a lactor, recently reggable proceeded with the partial exercise of its coal option to acquire a 3% of the lactors, and there is a remaining 4.5%, apart from these 4.5%, is there anything to dispose part of, of your stake in a lactor? My second question is about the construction of a combined single gas turbine with Yecturna fire plant, which said to be completed by the end of the year, and I would like to ask you about the contribution of this termination activity to groups, EBITDA. And, and my third question is about the dividend policy. Last year, you proceeded with the distribution of the highest ever given of 1.8% per share. Is, if you thought that it's sustainable, the distribution of an amount close to that figure, and I have one more question about the new refining capacities in Middle East and especially in Africa, in Nigeria. How do you think that these additions will pressure your refining margin? Thank you. Let me continue writing, so I remember. Now, there are no immediate plans to dispose the remaining shares of a lactor. For the time being, you know, we are happy with how the collaboration and the whole, you know, the company proceeds. Don't forget, we just got a capital return recently. And, and, you know, the company has been doing well, and I think the share price has been, you know, is about two, two euros already, even though they paid, you know, this capital return. We've got, so for the time being, no, there isn't any plan. For comotini, the plant technically is ready, but we expect the remaining connection from the power transmission operator, and we expect commissioning to happen in about October, in the fourth quarter, and commercial operation at the beginning, at the first quarter of next year. So, we do not expect any bidar contribution for this year, but we definitely expect it at the beginning of the next year. Of course, sorry, it's not a bidar attack with the consolidation because it's 50-50, but but anyway, so trial operation Q4, and production and commercial operation in Q1. Ah, new refining capacity. Clearly, the new refining capacity is creating, shall we say, global pressure on margins. Of course, a lot of it goes to the states, and it goes, you know, it travels all over the world. Usually, what, you know, experience tells is that the balance is found, and the balance usually penalizes the weakest link, and therefore, refineries that are much simpler, or inland, or have fewer, and or have fewer possibilities, optionalities with the crude supply, they are going to be hit most and first. And usually, when we see additional capacity coming in operation, then we have a period of closures and a period of reduced throughput. So, I guess, we will, this, you know, history will repeat itself, and we have, we will have a similar situation. Dividend, I would say, I wouldn't call it dividend policy per se. It is more related to a, you know, steady, healthy yield over the years. When we have, you know, good profits, we give a good dividend. When we have lower profits, we still theoretically give a good dividend, but it's not as good as, you know, it wasn't the high in the top years. Common sense says that, to 2023, dividend cannot be repeated in 2024, even only if one considers, you know, this extra taxation. But, you know, we still have another five months ago, four and a half months ago. So, let's see how the year evolves. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Daddakis for any closing comments. Thank you. Just to say thank you, good questions. As always, I would say, you know, people are doing a lot of homework and they are asking good questions. So, thank you very much to all of you and hopefully see you soon in one of the coming conferences. Take care, all of you. Bye-bye.
