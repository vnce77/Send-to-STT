Good afternoon everybody. Thank you for enduring snow and cold weather and anyway happy Veterans Day even though you guys had to endure the parade but it's an important thing for us to acknowledge. It's been a very interesting 12 months or so since I joined AMD. We've been two and a half years or so since we've done an analyst day and thank you guys all for coming out and spending some time with us. I know your time is valuable and we really appreciate it. I get to present the most exciting slide of the day for you with really good vision. This is our cautionary statement. Turns out the entire point of us having one of these analyst days is to make forward-looking statements so we're gonna make plenty of those but it is important that you guys take note of the cautionary statement and go look for the risks and uncertainties that come with the forward-looking statements that we make. Those are gonna be in the 10Q and 10K filings that we file with the SEC and you guys know the drill. In addition to that pretty much every number that we're gonna talk about today on stage is a non-gap number. In the appendices of the slides and on our SEC filings there are gap to non-gap reconciliations of all of those numbers so please take note of that as you digest the financial information that we give here today. So here is the agenda. I think we have a lot of really substantive things to say that are relevant to the market, relevant to our business, relevant to our technologies. You guys will get to hear from from Lisa introducing everything about AMD and from Mark to talk about the technical roadmaps over the last 10 years and over the 10 years coming in the future. Then Forrest and Dan and Vamzi are gonna spend about an hour going through the data center business in detail and then we'll take a break. The one thing that I would ask you, we're webcasting all this and trying to time it and everything. If you could please take your 20-minute break and be back in your seats when we get ready to kick off again I would really appreciate it. After the break Jack and Salillo will talk through both the client and gaming's business and the embedded business at AMD and then Gene will come up with the financial model that you guys are sure will stick around for at the end and Lisa will bring us back to close before we do Q&A at the end. It should be a really really good day and we're very thankful that you've come and spent it with us. Now without further ado I get to do something that's an absolute thrill for me personally but probably unnecessary for you guys. Introduce someone that absolutely needs no introduction to this audience but there's our chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Sue. All right good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us here in New York and thanks to everyone joining us online. We're really excited to be here today excited to see so many friendly faces and really excited to talk about really what's happening in the market. I mean it's a really special time for the technology industry for the technology market AI overall but then also it's a very exciting time for AMD. So let me go ahead and get started. What I'd like to do is basically give you a bit of an overview starting with you know some of our strategy some of our execution and then really what we see going forward and then have the team really take you through the deep dive but you know starting first with our overall mission I think we've been very consistent here that you know high performance computing is the foundation of really everything that's important. When you talk about solving some of the world's most important challenges we've actually added its high performance in AI computing because AI is such a large piece of the computing world today but this is our goal in life this is what we wake up every day to do and when you know we look at where we are today I'd like to say that AMD computing touches billions of people every day because it's true. When you look across you know data center cloud some of the most important services that everyone uses in enterprises or personal talk about edge and intelligent devices talking about all of the different market segments where you need and use computing you can see AMD throughout all of those places and increasingly you see AI everywhere as well so that's going to be another theme of our day is that yes we're going to spend a lot of time talking about the cloud and the data center because you know those are the largest markets but we're really seeing AI diffuse through all aspects of the business including it at the edge and in the client world so you know a little bit about just you know focus areas and how we got here when I look back you say so much has changed over the last few years if you think about how the market has really evolved over the past few years but I actually for us our strategy has stayed very consistent I mean this is what we said we're our strategic strategic pillars a few years ago and when I look back on it I say you know these actually these are exactly the things that we invested in exactly the things that we were focused on and I'll talk a little bit about how things have evolved over the last few years certainly compute technology leadership that's our foundation we have to have the compute capability but we said that data center was going to be the most strategic market for AMD this is where we saw tremendous growth this is actually the part of the of the industry that fits you know our capabilities the best and we've really expanded our data center business ensuring that AI goes across every aspect of our product portfolio was also a key pillar and ensuring that we had the software many of you guys have asked us about our software and what we're doing around the software so we'll talk more about that and then also using the entire power of our IP portfolio to offer both standard as well as semi-custom solutions and you know these are areas where we think over the long-term there are lots and lots of needs for compute in the industry and you want to have sort of the right compute for the right workload and so you know you need sort of whole you know tool chest to really go through that and so just taking a look at you know some of the progress over the past a couple of years I think you know our data center execution has been extremely strong I mean we've grown this business from you know sort of two billion dollars in 2020 to you know this year estimated over 16 billion you know over 50 percent growth rate and when you look at you know sort of the underpinnings of that I think there's no question that you know when we started with the Zen roadmap family and epic I think people were wondering you know hey just how much traction are you going to get Lisa is this a place where you have you know durable you know long-term competitive advantage and I think we've taken what was a very very clear technology bet and really understood where the market is going and you know as a result you see epic now in you know just about everywhere so 10 out of the 10 largest hyperscalers you know every one of the most important social media services we're actually in over 60 percent of the fortune 100 today and growing and so that's been you know a really really strong success story and then we've also had our instinct in our GPU product line which you know with MI 300 MI 325 and now the MI 350 series we ramped this you know faster than any other product in AMD history with seven out of the top 10 AI companies now using AMD instinct products the top two fastest super computers and many strategic partnerships that have been announced in our in the works so you know looking at some of the numbers what is that meant to our business we are now let's call it roughly about 40 percent revenue share of the market in the most attractive segments of the market so large hyperscaler you know very much standardizing you know AMD technology through our five generations in addition to you know growing enterprise footprint what that's meant is data centers now our largest segment so almost half of our business 47 percent of our business to be approximate there and it's growing it's growing much faster than the other pieces one because the TAM is growing and the other because we are extremely well positioned from a product portfolio standpoint on the AI side we're gonna talk a lot about AI today we're gonna talk a lot about data center AI but I just wanted to you know put the picture in terms of you know what's been happening in the AI business for AMD clearly the rate and pace of innovation in AI is faster than anything that we've seen before we've compressed our schedules so that we went from what was a two-year cycle to an annual cadence I think we've done well with adoption of MI 300 MI 325 and MI 355 but there is a huge step function in front of us with the MI 450 series and that's both in terms of technology you know just sheer rock capacity capability as well as going to our rack scale solutions as well as you know frankly where the market is so it's a great time for a market that is inflecting in a big way as we're going forward just a little bit of an overview on the client I'm in gaming business you're gonna meet Jackie and today some of you may not have met him before he's our new leader in the client in gaming segment I think we've done a fantastic job with this business you know people have often asked us you know what do we think of the PC market I mean the PC market is a great market it's a market where a lot of silicon is consumed people this is how you know people really touch compute what was most important for us in this market is that we picked the segments where technology mattered and we focused on those segments and ensured that we had product leadership so when you think about premium when you think about gaming when you think about enterprise those are the most attractive portions of the client market and that's where we have done exceptionally well particularly over the last 12 to 18 months and so when you put all that together you know we are currently at you know 28% you know client revenue share but we're really inflecting in this business as well over 50% of the desktop CPU channel and we're at a place where AI is really in its infancy in the PC market and so as that scales I think our product portfolio strengthens and we see this as a growth market for us as well and then you're going to hear from Cilio Raje on the embedded you know business and the embedded business is really primarily the former Zilinx business together with the embedded x86 business and what you see in this business is you know put aside there's been you know some let's call it noise over the past couple of years as there's been you know a bit of inventory correction overall and what we see is an extremely strong business that has access to a set of markets that AMD never had access to before so over 7,000 customers you know automotive industrial aerospace and defense communications we are in all of the largest firms from a technology standpoint and perhaps in this business the most important metric is not near-term revenue because the near-term revenue is very much a matter of things that happened in the past but the most important thing is design wind growth and what you're going to hear from Cilio is since the acquisition of Zilinx and the integration into AMD we have grown design wins at a significantly faster pace than sort of the the former Zilinx from an FPGA only portfolio our design wins have exceeded have exceeded 14 billion dollars in 2024 we're on a path to exceed 16 billion dollars this year so over 50 billion dollars of new design wins at a category of 21% and that gives us a great confidence of the long-term revenue trajectory and Cilio will talk about some of the ways where bringing the portfolio together has really ended up with tremendous synergies and then one area that we haven't talked a lot about with this audience but I thought this would be a good time to bring out is where we are with semi-custom design wins you know if you think about you know my philosophy on semi-custom has always been you need to have the right product for the right workload for you know for for customers and when you get into very high volume or very specific workloads there are advantages to taking a standard product and really customizing it for those specific workloads what has been well known for AMD is you know we've been number one in game consoles for a long time you know we're very thankful of the relationships that we have with the gaming customers and that was you know let's call it about 20 billion dollars of lifetime revenue give or take when you think about a five or seven year cycle of that business what we have done though over the last 12 to 18 months is really expand the aperture of what we do in terms of semi-custom and what that has really done is it's taken you know certainly we're very you know pleased with this traditional gaming business that we've been a part of but we've closed new design wins in aerospace and defense automotive data center as well as communications now totaling over forty five billion dollars of one design win content that would be revenue starting ramp in 2026 and beyond so I think that tells you the power of the model we'll talk a little bit about the technology underlying that and how we've been able to do that with some of the technology investments that we've made but this is an example of where you know I think our strategy our long-term strategy in investing in a modular IP roadmap and the ability to mix and match the different pieces of our IP portfolio has really paid off and I think this will be an area of consistent growth for us going forward so putting all that together the other piece of it that I think we have been very focused on is strategic investments you know this is an area where you know we always have to bet ahead of the curve we have to make strategic bets and there's no question by and far the largest bet that we've made is you know really in AI so if you look at just our organic investments we've significantly ramped the engineering talent in the company so we have over 25,000 engineers now both hardware and software the largest growth in engineers has been in software and platform which you might expect given where we're going with you know AI systems we've also built what I would say is a is an M&A machine we are now very confident and comfortable with M&A execution I know that when we you know first started this silinks was the first large acquisition that we did you know people were always like Lisa are you sure you can integrate this and add value and you know not have disenergies I think what we've shown is excellent execution on the large ones you know zylinks is added you know in addition to the the revenue in the business that we're going to talk about it's added significant technology capability when you think about the the AI engines when you think about the 30s capability when you think about the software capability and our leadership of our AI is under Vomsey Bopanna right now who is a very a very key executive in that we also have added with Pensando significant networking expertise that is a key part of our AI capability and with ZT systems we've added all of the rack scale solutions expertise that has from day one started adding value and accruing value to our MI 450 and Helios capabilities in addition to that we've done a number of software acquisitions many of these are smaller acquisitions but what we've done here is really in the in the essence of trying to ensure that we have as much and as fast or ramp as possible on our rock and software stack we have you know found some excellent excellent teams that have added to Vomsey's team to ensure that we have you know best in class from a software standpoint the other arm that we have you know we have started with is a much more active venture investments arm so I would say this was something that we didn't do as much a few years ago but now this is an active part of our portfolio Matt Hein runs it for us and here what we're looking for is really you know I wouldn't say picking winners and losers because it's hard to pick winners and losers when you're investing in startups but it's picking leaders who we think will be influential in the AI ecosystem whether it's hardware software application level model level to ensure that you know we are keeping a good pulse on what's happening in the ecosystem and also ensuring that we familiarize people with AMD content so these are the key strategic investments that we've made which I think have really added to our capabilities in AI so putting that all together I think the you know overall revenue growth story has been a strong story we're now projecting to be about 34 billion dollars this year from a much smaller number in previous years and that's also significantly improved our overall profitability so that kind of gives you an idea of how we got to today now let's talk about where we're going because I think that is you know clearly there's so much that's going on in the industry you know we want to give you a sense for where we think our place in the industry is and also you know where the market is really going so starting first with some of the market trends you know I'll spend a little bit of time in terms of the market trends because I know that you guys are all you know think of them about these things I would say that the rate and pace of change in AI is certainly beyond anything that I've seen you know in my sort of tech history a super intense speed and pace that you're seeing just massive infrastructure build out and you know what do I mean by that I mean when we talked to all of our largest customers we've actually seen this because we're always talking to our customers and if I asked them last year they might have said hey Lisa you know we're investing right now but we believe it'll level off you know as we as the compute comes on board and if you ask them today what they would say is no it's actually not going to level off we need to accelerate we need to put more AI infrastructure in place because there's a real belief that you know AI compute really equates to intelligence so if you have the chance if you have the balance sheet if you have the capability to put on more compute you're going to do it because it's going to give you incremental advantage versus your competition so it's really I would say an insatiable demand for AI compute which is you know kind of interesting there's obviously lots of work on power and ensuring that you get the the full you know power and data center build out ready for that we're also seeing that you know it is really too early to talk about you know the winners and losers there are lots and lots of models out there I think the number of models is growing in addition to the foundational model companies which most people spend time on there are lots of the next layer of companies that are helping enterprises really use AI in terms of you know fine-tuning and other services that you add to it and I think that's going to become more important and then probably one of the trends that you guys have asked us about from time to time is what happens to the CPU market when you have AI accelerators growing so fast and I think that somehow GPUs would take a lot of the CPU workloads I think what we have seen is that is not true we've actually seen you know the opposite be true as we've gone through as more AI has deployed from a you know let's call it the models are out there as people are using AI in enterprises we're actually seeing that the CPU demand is is accelerating and Dan McNamara is going to talk a lot about why we think that's happening what we see and it's now a consistent trend that we're seeing with multiple large customers as well as you know both on the cloud side as well as the enterprise side so I think it's a great thing I think it makes sense right AI is driving you know new intelligence new capability as you have more agents out there those agents have to work on something and you know they're working on things that require more general-purpose compute we are seeing inferencing growing faster than training I think that's all that's something that we all kind of expected but it's we're starting to see that now the enterprise-class solutions are also starting I would still say relatively early in the adoption curve but there's a lot of interest and experimentation there and then clearly you know sovereign AI and nation-scale deployments is an area where we continue to see you know every country wants to have control of their own AI compute and they want to be able to select how they how they deploy that and this is one of the key trends that's also accelerating the tam growth overall and then you know as you go beyond the cloud I think we will see more AI whether you're talking about at the edge or in PCs as this is a way where new experiences are coming in this is also still early in the cycle so I would say this would be in this in the latter part of the growth for our long-range plan but it is it is certainly an area that we think is interesting so when you put all that together and you know we talk about what market sizes are you know it's always hard to call what a TAM is when we first you know started you're talking about the AI TAM I think we started at 300 billion and then we updated it to 400 and then 500 and I think many of you said well that seems too high Lisa you know why would you think that those numbers should be so high it turns out that we were probably you know closer to right than wrong in terms of just the acceleration of AI AI spend and that really came from I would say lots of discussion with lots of customers in terms of how they saw their computing needs frame out so when we look at the market now what we decided to do is a couple things one is extend our range from you know really over the next five years so 2030 TAM and also think about it as a more inclusive TAM to not only include accelerators which is very important but also include CPUs and some of the networking content that we add to so you know our current perspective is we're talking about a TAM that is greater than a trillion dollars by 2030 we've seen you know if I look at our previous forecast at greater than 500 for 2028 we're seeing that number come up significantly and then we expect that you know there will you know there will be extensions of that growth rate going into a 29 and 30 so it's an exciting market there's no question data center is you know the largest growth opportunity out there and one that AMD is very very well positioned for so that kind of sets the stage of where we're choosing to invest going forward so now in terms of our strategic pillars similar types of things I mean what I what I really want to emphasize is you know our strategy has been very very consistent and I think you need to be when you're in the technology space because you know frankly these these product cycles are long these are our strategic pillars and this is how we're going to organize the day for you we start with just compute technology leadership you know that's foundational to everything that we do we are extremely focused on data center leadership and that data center leadership includes you know silicon it includes software it includes the rack scale solutions that go along with that and then you know part of our software story is not just that we will have a very competitive software stack it's also that we have a software stack that extends across all platforms from cloud to edge to client and so we'll talk a little bit about that and then powering AI everywhere outside of the cloud so if I just double click on each one of those to kind of give you the highlights of perhaps what we would like you to spend some time on first on the technology leadership you know mark paper master is going to take you through this marks been you know my partner over the last 10 years really developing sort of the entire technology stack that we have at AMD I think we're very proud of the fact that we made some good decisions along the way you know clearly our investments in the foundational CPU and GPU IP were critical but that's really expanded I think the the fact of the matter is these systems are going getting so complex these days I mean our triplets now are you know mixing and matching all of the latest and greatest technologies it's extremely important to have the right interconnect I think our bet on infinity fabric allowed us to do that I think we're leading the industry in terms of advanced packaging and we're making significant investments in the cities and other technologies that are necessary to interconnect all these things so mark will take you through that but the key is you know our absolute commitment is ensuring that we invest for technology leadership across the board and I think the team has done a great job with that in terms of the data center as Matt said we're going to spend a good amount of today on this you know about an hour and that's going to be gone through with forest Vamci and Dan this is really an all-company affair so if you want to talk about something that is front and center for everyone at AMD it's it's ensuring that we accelerate our data center leadership I think the thought here is you know really across all of the major segments cloud enterprise and super computing ensuring that we have the right compute for the right workload I am a big believer in there is no one solution that scales across every market segment you know every segment has you know kind of a uniqueness that is trying to drive with its workloads and that's across CPUs and GPUs and accelerators as well as you know across you know sort of high-end mid-range and sort of entry level and so I think we've built an expansive portfolio to do that and we'll talk you know more about that I think the other piece of our data center strategy that is unique is you know our intention is to have a extremely capable full rack scale solution but it's also to do that in an open ecosystem and in an open ecosystem means that our customers can decide whether they use all AMD which we're very happy if they choose to use all AMD or we're also okay if they want to interoperate with other standards out there because it's good for their business because they have other things that they're trying to optimize and so that continues to be a key foundation and and forest will certainly go through that on the software side I think we've made tremendous progress in this area this has been one of the areas where people have said that we have needed to make a significant investment and I think we've done that I think Rockham is you know today the industry's premier open-source AI stack what we've done is really get significantly more focused on ensuring that we have native support for all of the Day Zero models native support for all of the leading open source you know frameworks out there and that has you know really been something that Vomci and his team have worked on and also ensuring that you know we have the full stack of enterprise solutions and developer solutions out there I will say that we have greatly expanded from you know just serving the largest hyperscalers to really serving the broad developer base with with Rockham so this is an area that Vomci will go through in quite some detail and what that says is you know we have now all of the pieces to deliver full AI factories and you know that is really our goal throughout this entire stack across CPUs GPUs software networking and our cluster level systems design so in terms of you know powering AI everywhere this will be covered by Cilial and Jack AIPC's gaming edge AI physical AI these are all places where we think our IP also plays very well and we will continue to ensure that we have a full ecosystem that covers all of these capabilities so that gives you a little bit on the technology strategy in terms of you know what this means for our business so I'm going to let Jean go through the full financial model this afternoon so you have to kind of give us a few hours to go through all the technology that's okay right I mean like we want to make sure that you stay interested and engaged but what I thought I would do is maybe give you a few nuggets of how we think about growth so you can have that in mind as we're going through each of the presentations so first in terms of strategic partnerships I think what has been really critical to us is to ensure that you know for to be successful in the AI industry I think deep partnerships are super important because these systems are so complex and because these roadmaps are multi-generational and I think that's really what we've done with our strategic partnerships we've recently announced several partnerships I'd like to give you maybe a little bit of context of how those fit in and then how those fit into what we think our growth trajectory is you know first open AI I think we're very excited to announce a six gigawatt partnership with OpenAI they are clearly the leader in frontier model development we have been working with them for some time I would say at the early stages but the key is I think we actually took the opportunity to develop MI 450 series for many of the use cases that were most important to OpenAI including optimized inference you know use cases and so to be able to announce a six gigawatt deal over five years I think that sets a real foundation for our roadmap and for our overall adoption curve we also announced a expansion of our Oracle partnership to MI 450 so Oracle will be one of the first if not the first to offer public instances of MI 450 and what we're really trying to do here is you know our experience is when we finish development to when you actually see a public instance can actually take some time because you know that these are very very complex systems you know our goal really with these partnerships is to get it to the place where when we finish development you can actually go and get an MI-MI 450 instance in the cloud very shortly and so that that partnership is really targeting your third quarter in 26 as the ramp of that capability we also talked about and showed for the first time our Helios rack scale solution with our partnership with meta and I'll mention a little bit of context of why this has been really critical so first of all meta has been an excellent partner for us across MI 300 MI 350 they've been very involved in the software work both on the PyTorch ecosystem as well as you know just the you know overall rock them ecosystem when we really went to rack scale solutions you know we had two choices our choice was you know either we develop it on our own and you know have all kinds of you know proprietary system design and we certainly could have done that but what in our you know true partnership mode we said what the industry really wants is more of an open rack architecture because the idea that yes you can use you know AMD MI 450s is great but being able to ensure that there are set of open standards so that the ecosystem can develop more holistically was important and so I think the Helios design based on the open standards with meta really enables that and so I think we're very pleased with that partnership and then we also announced a couple of new supercomputers with the Department of Energy that are adopting the MI 400 series capabilities actually a new product that we put on the road map the MI 430 which you know obviously we'll talk a little bit more about so putting all of these in place I would say is a good foundation to talk about what we think our you know AI growth models are what's been clear is that there's a lot of excitement around MI 450 series and Helios in addition to some of the customer engagements that we just talked about we have strong momentum with multiple additional gigawatt scale opportunities and you know those are you know very very much in you know deep design phase with these customers and I think what customers are telling us is look there's a real need for more compute and you know what we have with the MI 450 and with Helios is extremely competitive in many cases you know leadership when you think about the memory capability as well as a scale-up bandwidth and we've also co-developed with these and so we have you know multiple hyperscaler AI natives and sovereign opportunities that well are well under underway and we talked about a revenue target of you know let's call it you know tens of billions of dollars in 2027 so I can say that we're on track to that but we also see a very clear path to you know double-digit share in this very important data center AI market and that translates into let's call it a growth rate of you know over 80 percent AI revenue cagger over the next three to five years so when we talk about financial model today we're gonna frame it over the next three to five years and and so that this is you know kind of what we see as our potential given the customer traction both with the announced customers as well as customers that are currently working very closely with us now as exciting as the data center AI you know revenue opportunity is for us the other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders and that's actually a very nice place to be some of the other you know key targets that we're going to talk about today are areas where we think we have the ability to grow significantly ahead of the market dynamics so on the server side then McNamara is going to show you sitting currently at approximately 40 percent share we have a clear path to over 50 percent revenue share of the server market over a larger TAM over the next three to five years Jack we'll talk about our client revenue market share we're sitting let's call it in the high 20s right now again a clear path to over 40 percent client revenue market share in this three to five year time frame and then Celia we'll talk about what we see in the embedded market again the opportunity to grow significantly ahead of the market to over 70 percent of the embedded adaptive revenue market share over the next three to five years so I think all of these are really exciting targets I think each of the businesses will you know really go through their strategy their product road maps and you know why they see a clear line of sight to this at the AMD level I want to give you some ideas of how we think about revenue growth at the AMD level so at the AMD level what we would say is we expect to really inflect in over revenue overall revenue growth over the next three to five years we've done very well over the last few years growing over 20 percent but we really see the opportunity to now take the overall company you know at a scale of let's call it a baseline in 2025 of 34 billion dollars to grow at over 35 percent Kagger at the total company level and that's broken up into you know the data center business growing you know well ahead of the market at over 60 percent Kagger and the core businesses that's clients and embedded growing also well ahead of the market at over 10 percent Kagger so that kind of gives you a flavor of the type of growth that we're talking about it's an exciting growth trajectory that we have I'm going to leave the rest of the financial model to gene so she'll have a bunch to to talk about as we wrap up the day towards the end but that just gives you you know kind of a flavor of why we're so excited about this time in the industry and this time for AMD I think we have just all the confluence of events that you would want to have if you're in tech today right we have a large and growing Tam over a trillion dollar Tam at the data center level and that adds at the company level I think we have a fantastic product portfolio I think as a team I think hopefully you will have seen that we are good at execution when we say that we're going to do something we're going to do it we have great foundation with deep strategic partnerships and the data center has a tremendously expanded and we've expanded our capabilities as well so with that let me turn it over to the team to give you all the details so Mark you want to join me please thank you Lisa and I really appreciate you all being here with today and the opportunity I have to share with you our technology portfolio I've been in the industry for decades and I've never seen such a time of just incredible pace of transition of new technology
