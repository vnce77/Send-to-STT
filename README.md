I would now turn the conference over to your host, Candida Hayden, senior analyst and investor relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Joanna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Franco Nevada's 2nd quarter 2025 results. Accompanying this call is a presentation which is available on our website at franco-navada.com. We will also find our full financial results. The presentation is also available to view on the webcast. During our coldest morning, full-brank president and chief financial officer who will provide a brief review of our results. This will be followed by a Q&A period. Our full executive team is available to answer any questions. Participants may submit questions by telephone or via the webcast. We would like to remind participants that some of today's commentary may contain forward-looking information and we refer you to our detailed cautionary note on slide 2 of this presentation. I will now turn over the call to Paul Brank, president and CEO of franco-navada. Thank you, Candida. Good morning, all. For Q1 this year, we announced record financial results. And now for Q2, we're surpassing those with new records. Our portfolio largely produced as expected for the quarter and high-volt prices pro-recorder revenue operating cash flow adjusted EBITDA margins and earnings. We also saw constructive developments in Panama, including approval of the preservation and safe maintenance plan and shipment of the remaining constant trade from corporate Panama. Sentiment in country continues to shift in favor of a restart of the operation and I am encouraged by the Molina government's continued commitment to resolving the situation. We have attractive growth over the next five years from our existing portfolio. In particular, we'll be big beneficiaries of the move to unlock mind permitting process in the U.S. Three projects in our outlook are now moving ahead. Perpetuous, Stibnite Gold had based couple world, and the news this morning is that Castle Mountain has been included in the FAS-41 permitting process. One project that's potentially new to our five-year outlook is Caskey Belt. The new management team at Solgold has been studying approaches to accelerate production, and it's now indicating first production may occur as soon as 2028. One longer-term shift in relations with the Chilquoten First Nation at new prosperity. You may recall that Franco has a screen financing agreement to acquire a 22% gold stream. This could be a very meaningful growth driver for Franco if the Chilquoten decided to support mind development. During the quarter, we acquired a world on iron gold's Cote gold mine, one of Canada's newest large-scale gold mines, and we're off to goods since our acquisition iron gold's achieved namely throughput for head of schedule and positive grade reconciliation. Cote and Goslin have 16 million ounces of M&I and more than four million ounces of inferred resources. I'm gold's targeting more than 20 million ounces of M&I and an updated resource expected in the first half of 2026. The current mill is undersized for that scale of resource, and I am gold's planning to polish an updated technical report in 2026 with the expansion scenarios. Our team believes something in the order of 20 million tons of brand with throughput would be better suited to the size of your body. Post-quarter end with wider royalty on angle gold's Arthur Project, comprised of the Merlin and Silicon deposits, which together form one of the largest gold discoveries in recent years in Nevada. Angle gold has rapidly expanded the resources in the last couple years, and I wouldn't be surprised if the current resource, which stands at 3.4 million ounces indicated, and 12.9 million ounces inferred, grows at a similar trajectory to gold strike or Cortez in their AD. Since our acquisition, angle gold's announced transaction to further consolidate the district and has pointed to ongoing high-grade drilling success. The Merlin initial assessment outlines the first number of years of production at 1 million ounces of brand, and if more high-grade has found that production rate could be maintained for an extended period. The scale of the operation contemplated is already in the league of gold strike and Cortez. The last two years have been some of our most productive adding assets to the portfolio. Last year, we added interest from some of the world's biggest mineral announcements. New Monteonicotra operations in Peru, in Sabinea's PGM operations in the western limb of the bush belt in South Africa, and Seoul Gold's Cask about Copper Gold development project in Ecuador. This year, we've expanded exposure in Canada and the U.S., adding current production from the porcupine and Cortez operations in Ontario, and the Arthur project, as mentioned, in our namesake state, Nevada. Combined, the acquisition over the last two years has transformed our longer-term growth outlook. Add the potential of a covery restart and longer-term development of new prosperity, and you have the most exciting growth outlook in the space. The deal pipeline continues to be strong. We've dipped into our corporate revolver to complete the Arthur acquisition, and we're happy to use this facility for transactions for the transactions we see ahead of us. With roughly 1.3 billion in annual cash flow generation, we can repay the facility rapidly. For that, I'll pass the call over to Sandy. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. As Paul mentioned, Frank and Nevada reported record financial results for second-quarter ended June 30th, 2025. Our portfolio generally performed in line with expectations, and we continue to benefit from higher precious metal prices. Precious metal prices with gold in particular continue to be strong. On slide four, you will see the comparison of commodity prices for Q2 2025 and Q2 2024. Gold and silver prices increased significantly year-over-year with the average bull price higher by 40% in the quarter and average silver price higher by 17%. We've also seen a rebound in prices for platinum and palladium. Prices for iron ore and oil continue to be volatile and will lower compared to prior year. However, you did see a significant increase in natural gas prices. On slide five, we highlight some of the key metrics used to measure performance. Total geo-sold, net geo-sold, revenue, and adjust city-but-done. Total geo-sold increased 2% to 112,093 in the quarter compared to 110,264 in second quarter 2024. Precious metal geo-sold in the quarter were 92449, higher by 12% compared to prior year. For the quarter, we did receive strong contributions from Guadalupe and Candeleria and continue to benefit from the recent acquisitions made at Yannick Ocha and Western Plim. During the quarter, we recorded our first revenues related to the recently acquired royalties on porcupine, operated by Discovery Silver, and Cote Gold, operated by Ungold. We look forward to a full quarter of revenue from these assets in Q3. In addition to the better performance from Guadalupe and Candeleria and receiving geo-sold from the recent acquisitions, we also benefited from continued ramp-ups of operations that new mines tokens inio, greenstone, and Solaris notane. With respect to the Hamlo MPI, it was another strong quarter showcasing the leverage of the MPI to higher gold prices. However, the MPI can vary depending on how much production comes from the area covered by our MPI alliance. One asset that was lower than our expectation was Antebecai, but this was solely due to timing of deliveries. We expect a stronger second half of the year from this asset. Diversified geo-sold were $19,644 for the quarter compared to $27,914 for prior year quarter, despite diversified revenue being slightly lower year over year, $62.7 million versus $64.6 million. The geo-sold reduction is due to the impact of higher gold prices when converting diversified revenue to geo's. As you can see on the chart, total revenue increased 42% for the quarter to $369.4 million, which is a record for Franklin Nevada. Precious metals accounted for 82% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, also a record was 65% higher for the quarter at $365.7 million compared to $221.9 million in second quarter 2024. Slide 6 details the key financial metrics reported by the company. As mentioned, total geo-sold were $112,093, generating $369.4 million in record revenue in the quarter. As you know, Franklin Nevada is a royalty and streaming company. For royalties, we typically receive payment in cash. However, for some of our royalties, we do take payment in kind rather than cash and have been accumulating the inventory over time. To fund the quota gold royalty acquisition, we liquidated the majority of our inventory position. This resulted in a gain on sale of gold bullion of $42.2 million as the average cost of the gold ounces we sold was approximately 2,350 pounds. At the end of June, we still have 2,469 gold ounces remaining in inventory. With respect to cost, we did have an increase in cost of sales compared to Q22024 due to higher stream ounces sold. Cost of sales was $33.5 million versus $29.1 million last year. Depletion increased to $64 million versus $52.9 million a year ago. As we received more geos from Candeluria and began depleting our recent transactions, Yannicotia, Western Limp, and Porcupine, this impacted depletion as those assets are currently higher per ounce depletion essence. Adjust the net income was $238.5 million or $1.24 per share for the quarter, both up 65% versus prior year. Slide 7 highlights the continued diversification of the portfolio. 82% of our Q22025 revenue was generated by precious metals, with revenue being sourced 86% from the Americas. Our largest contributor to revenue was Candeluria at 15% for the quarter. Slide 8 illustrates the strength of our business model to continue to generate high margins. For second quarter 2025, the cash cost per GEO is $299 per GEO. This compares to 264 per GEO in prior year. As the gold price has risen, Franklin Nevada has seen a significant increase in our margin per GEO. Margin was just shy of $3,000 per GEO in the quarter. Slide 9 summarizes the financial resources available to the company. The company had $160.3 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of June, when including our credit facility at $1 billion and our equity investments, total available capital at June 30th 2025 is $1.6 billion. However, in July, we did fund the acquisition of a rural to an annual Golds Arthur project in Nevada, as mentioned by Paul, for $250 million in upfront cash. We did draw on our credit facility for $175 million to assist in funding this acquisition. This results in total available capital of approximately $1.35 billion currently. The company continues to remain well capitalized to continue to add long life high quality assets to the portfolio. And before I turn it over to Joanne to take questions, I would like to remind you of our guidance ranges for the year. Our original guidance was for $465,000 to $525,000 total GEOs for 2025, with $385,000 to $425,000 precious metal GEOs. This was using $2,800 per ounce full price. By updating price assumptions with current commodity prices, we continue to remain on pace to achieve our total GEOs and precious metal GEO guidance ranges. Also, as mentioned, we will recognize revenue from Colbreak Hanima in third order. As the concentrate on site has now been shipped, Franklin, Nevada has begun to receive deliveries of Gold and Silver from Colbreak Hanima based on our stream agreement. We expect to receive approximately 10,000 GEOs in Q3. And with that, I will pass it over to Joanna, and we're happy to answer any questions you may have. Of course, during this Q&A session, if you would like to ask a question, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star two. If you are joining us on the webcast, please submit your question through the Q&A section of the webcast platform. First question on the phone is from Fahad Karik at Jeffries. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. On Colbreak Hanima, can you maybe give some more color on why Franklin decided to suspend the arbitration proceeding? Fahad, it's full. The best outcome for us at Colbreak Hanima, and I'd say the first quantum as well, is to see that mine get back into operation. So I think between the first quantum, the government and sales, we're all like-minded to try and see a positive resolution. It had been a request at the outset from the millennial government that the operations be suspended to get the space to try and find a new solution. So we are very amenable to working with the government to allow that to happen. Okay, and then maybe switching gears to corporate development. Given the available capital is now lowered, you have some pretty large transactions, particularly COTE. Does that change how you think about deal size over the next a year or so? No way. I think so. The business continues to generate more and more cash every year. It's around 1.3 billion a year. So the no constraints on the capital side between the available capital with our revolver between the amount of cash we're generating. We've got plenty of firepower. They don't think it restricts us in any ways. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Larry Liu, CIPC. Please go ahead. Morning, Paula. Morning, Cindy. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another financially strong quarter. I guess I'll start off my question asking about platinum. Paula, you mentioned that platinum prices have rebound. And last December, Franco did a Sibanyan Western limb acquisition. I'm just wondering what kind of positive impact would that have on the asset and what's that factor in when the acquisition first happened? I'm there seeing, Grace speaking. Thank you for the question. Yes, we've been very pleasantly surprised versus our expectations with platinum. The price has moved up very significantly. We believe this provides an excellent tailwind to those operations and should allow a number of the extension projects that which we spoke about at the time to have much improved economics. So increases our confidence in the long term of those assets. For sure, that makes sense. Thanks Ian. Well, I have you as well. I'm going to follow so hard and ask about corporate development as well. I know there's historical precedence as well. I think about it sometimes takes shares in the companies, such as G Mining or Discovery Silver. I'm wondering, has that strategy changed in an upcoming time with gold prices hitting record high? And I guess second part of that question is, what's the intention of those shares? I see earlier, it's been factored into the potential capital available for the requisitions. Thanks for the question and maybe getting part of it. It's part of a longer term strategy and as a business, we compete in auctions to buy scheming assets and royalties. One area of the business we've been trying to develop is to say, how can we be not just transactional, but a financial backer to companies? If we can find great assets, great management teams that we want to support for the that strategy has played out with G Mining, it's played out with Discovery. We think that for those players, we can differentiate them and be their backer so that we can reduce the financial risk of those companies. And we think in doing that, we can increase their valuations and their ability to be successful over time. So far, that strategy has worked up terrifically. So we plan to continue both with those players and also if there are other teams that fit that role, we'd love to do more deals in that. But our role objective is how we support them as a long-term financial backer. For sure, that strategy definitely worked out really well for Franklin Nevada. I guess my last question is focused more around the long-term guidance that I made. So earlier in the call, Paul, you mentioned that there is a potential upper revision because of Caskable. Now could potentially be included in the five-year guidance. We're wondering if there's any more assets that could potentially be a surprise and included in your future five-year guidance. And when can we expect a updated five-year guidance? Would that be next year? Yeah, we do the guidance in the first part of the year, along with our annual results. So that's when we're updated. The two bits are positive news there. Obviously on Caskable, looking at scenarios to get things up and running sooner. There's two parts to that. The one is Tundayama, the open pit deposit. They've been drilling it up, having having good success, moving up some high-grade areas. So potentially that can be early material to the mill. Also looking at scenarios to start with sub-level caving while in a block cave. I think they're making good progress on both of those, and that's increasing their confidence that they can get it in production sooner. They have a good news that I mentioned today. If it is in our five-year growth outlook, it's just a certainty of it's going ahead. It's Castle Mountain. We do have two royalties on that, a 2.65 cent royalty that covers the whole property. We've got a further 2% royalty that covers one of the picks in particular that hopefully will be at the front end of the mine plan, taking that up to 4.65 on five-year old body. It's about a 200,000-ounce per year producer, so it could be a meaningful kicker in the back end of our five-year guns. Perfect. Sounds good. Sounds like there's more upside investors can look for, for sure. Thanks, Paul. Thanks, Ian. Thanks, indeed. Thanks for taking my question. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew Murphy at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hi. A big deal during the quarter on the Cote royalty. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a bit on your view on the asset. What gave you the confidence in the due diligence to take on a profit-based royalty? Are you willing to share your views on Cote's path to being a low-cost gold mine? Thank you, Matthew. It's Ian Gray again here. I guess, first of all, it's worth highlighting that we did work with Iron Bull on the acquisition, so that gave us unique insight into how it's currently operating and the long term for the asset. Honestly, it was one of the most exciting opportunities that we've looked at in quite some time. The scale of the resource is quite impressive, and if you refer to Iron Bull's call last week, they're starting to talk about a super bit between Cote and Gosling. So the potential of this to mirror some of the production profiles you see in assets like D2 or Malarctic, we see as quite robust, and that's based on being able to actually look at the data with Iron Bull and make that assessment. So we see as a result, fantastic opportunity going forward for the expansion and throughput to suit the scale of the resource, and what is also very exciting is that hopefully there's some news for you relatively near term on this as well as Iron Bull has identified that they'll be putting out an updated resource in the first half of next year, then hopefully a technical report identifying some of the production scenarios to follow. So we were able to get a sneak peek into the asset with the fact that we were able to uniquely do due diligence with Iron Bull, and that gave us the confidence to transact. And in terms of the cost profile, it's a good question, this is a new highly automated line with best practices and a team that we see as really first class led by Renault. And so as a result, we have a high level of confidence in the cost, and you will note this is gross margin royalty, so the deductions are fairly limited and we're able to work again with Iron Bull to craft a form of agreement that we're very happy with. So overall an extremely exciting opportunity which we think led low risk growth to Franklin Nevada over the long term. Okay, thank you for that. Also a question just on the quarter, you were a bit higher than expected on GEOs from oil and gas, and I guess Permian was one of the drivers. What's the O-Look for your Permian asset base back half of the year? I'm at the educational call speaking. We were pleasantly surprised by the performance of our Permian assets in the quarter. We had increased volumes over what we'd seen last year. Part of that is a result of drilling on our lands and at times operators will hit areas of higher royalty rates across our acreage footprint. So we benefited a little bit from that. Going forward, those assets in the Permian are usually fairly reflective of the overall performance of the basin. So it will depend on oil prices and how active drillers are. You will have seen oil prices have pulled back a little bit in recent months. So I would suspect that production levels and drilling activity will likely stay reasonably consistent perhaps soft and slightly with the lower price. Okay, thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Daniel Major at UBS. Please go ahead. Hi. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question. Just first one to clarify, Sandy, how much gold did you say you still had on the balance sheet in terms of inventory? Hey, Daniel. So at the end of June, we had 2,469 gold ounces still remaining inventory. Okay, so quite small. Okay, thanks. Yeah, and then the second question, just thinking about the guidance. So both the precious metal and the total Cheos is unchanged. You added about 20,000 ounces of additional sales that wasn't in the previous guidance from Kote and from Cobra Panama. What's the offset? Because I guess the implied non-gold Cheos is the same even after the change in the gold price assumption from 2,800 to 3,200. So what's the offset in the portfolio that means this is not a net upgrade to the precious metal GE guidance? Yeah, so I guess the key message there is that without even without Cobra Panama and Kote, we're still within the guidance ranges. Anything from Kote and Cobra Panama is all incremental. Right, so does that mean all else equal production is like it's been more skewed to the upper end of the range if you've added 20,000? Yeah, that's a fair assumption. Got it. Okay, thanks. And then the final question, the new prosperity option, the 22% gold stream, I'm not particularly familiar with this project. Can you give us a bit of a sense of quantum of what the contribution to Frank and Nevada might be? The prosperity is a large proper gold or free system in BC. The transaction that we had done was back in 2012 at the time they were trying to get it permitted. They had received a BC permit but weren't able to get a federal permit. Part of the issue was that they didn't have support of the Chilquotan First Nation at the time. So the project has effectively been parked for many years since then. The shift that was came out in June is they have an agreement with the Chilquotan. The ownership of just over 20% of the project is being provided to the Chilquotan Nation. The BC government is providing the funding which is the payment that goes to TSCO for that transfer and the Chilquotan will spend the next couple of years in a land use planning process to the site how they would like to proceed or not proceed with any project there. Our agreement that I have at weight is it's a 22% gold stream. It's a deposit is roughly half copper, half gold. I would have to check my numbers but it's in the order of 40, 50,000 ounces per year of gold that you would get from it. All right. Thanks for that. I'll let someone else have a go. Thank you. The next question comes from Tanya Jakusonik at Scorsha Bank. Please go ahead. Well, great. Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for taking out my questions. Just to finish off, Sandy, on the gold bullion. I mean, it's only like about $8 million. Is there about why wasn't it just all sold? Just we, at the end, we sold what we felt was needed to fund the Cote transaction, Tanya, plus we do accumulate over time. Like the bullion that we've had in inventory, roughly 45,000 ounces has been built up over time. Every quarter, we do receive gold and gold royalty payments in coin from some of our assets and we will continue to do so. That balance could potentially grow again depending upon what the deliveries are. Remind me which ones do you take in coin? Which royalties? There's a handful. We take D-Tor, Cassius, Brooklyn Lake, Porcupine, and Magino in coin. Okay. All right. So maybe we can start building a bit of an inventory there. Okay. Thank you for that. And just maybe just looking again at your guidance, is it safe to assume like I'm reading our previous notes? I think we were saying that Q3 was supposed to be generally equal to Q4 or thereabout. And with that 10,000 GEOs coming now in Q3, some Colbray tanima. Is that a bit of a skew? Should I be thinking a little bit higher in Q3 and lower in Q4 on that 4753 first half second half? I think that's a fair assumption. Obviously, we expect to get the bulk of the deliveries in Colbray Pan and Q3. Some could push into the early part of Q4. It just depends upon where the shipments go. But in terms of just overall, that's a fair assumption. And I need asking this, but any guidance on that, Hamlow, MPI? Your guess is as good as mine. Okay. And then can I be reminded, I saw this hilarious buyback, Goldfield boughtback, that one for example. Can you just roughly remind me which of your, you know, which ones have royalty screens, have some of these buyback that are potentially coming due? It's just, you know, there's a lot of money available now that Gold price is high, so there's potential for these buybacks. Can you just remind me which ones are you have and what are coming up? Come buyback. Hi, Tanya. It's Ian again here. Perhaps some of the most relevant for you. I would say, first of all, the asset handbook does a pretty good job summarizing for the full set. But some of the more relevant Cote has a buyback with Iron Gold, which is up to 50 percent. And that's fairly significant in the scheme of things. Porcupine also has that mechanism in it as well. So those would be relevant assets to keep track of. Sorry, Mr. First on the Iron Gold one. Yes, yes. Yes, sorry. Anything to do with follow-up? Yes, I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. On Cote, the recent transactions both Cote and Porcupine have that feature. Perfect. And maybe if I, since I have you on the line, I just wanted to come back about the opportunities that you are seeing out there. I ask everyone in terms of what, you know, you've done a couple. We've got a good mix between, you know, development and obviously production. The last two that you've done are adding right away. Arthur Gold is further out. What are you seeing out there in terms of mix between, you know, production available opportunities versus development? And I think the size had been in that 100 to 500 million ranges. That's still a for the question. Say, first of all, we're extremely happy with how we've been able to deliver on our business development plan, adding what we think are excellent assets. Fantastic upside in North America. So we'll continue to focus on assets similar to what you have seen. I would say, Tanya, in terms of size and size and scale in the last 12 months, being a very productive 12 months, we continue to see more of the same going forward. And so we're hopeful we'll be able to add significant growth to the portfolio. You're right. We've had a couple of cash flowing assets and whenever we have the opportunities to transact on those, that's first prize. But I think in terms of managing the overall portfolio, you know, we need to have a balance and have some longer-term growth. So we'll do both types of transactions as we move forward. At the moment, you know, focus really is on precious metals growth. And we have what I see is a very healthy pipeline of that moving forward. And we're focused on those private deals. Okay. And maybe Paul, if I could please one entry just on the prosperity option, you know, gosh, 2012 seems like a long, long time ago. I remember, did we write that asset off at the time? Was it written off? So Tanya, the deal we had was to say we put up 300 million, I believe, is the number for the financing, if and when it got permitted. So I haven't had any capital that's been expended on it. So no need to write anything off. Yeah. We took a small impairment at the time. Tanya, a few million dollars, which was just the cost associated with the asset. That's all highlighted. Nothing was funded under the capital commitment. Okay. All right. That was just what I was trying to understand. And then, Paul, I think you mentioned you think it's going to take a couple of years in terms of getting this, you know, to the table. Is that what I understood? Yes. You know, so the, to move the project forward, it needs the support of the show coordination. They have opposed mining in the past. Now they have an ownership stake in the project. So I think there's obviously very material benefits that they could get, if the mine does go ahead. I have no idea of timeline other than to say, you know, I can only imagine that it will take some time for them to consider the change in circumstance and, you know, before they would make any decisions on how to move ahead. Okay. Well, thank you. But, you know, obviously positive if we can have more projects permitted in Canada, especially BC. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. The next question comes from Brian McArthur at Raymond James. Please go ahead. Oh, good morning. Thank you. Tonya, I have a few of my questions. But can I just ask about muscle white as well? You highlighted the NPI model leverage. And again, Hemmel is the one we've always focused on. But muscle white was up pretty substantially this quarter. Is there anything other than just a straight gold price leverage going there with that 5% NPI? Like the two of, you never got anything from the 2% NSR or anything yet? Hi Brian, Sandy. Nothing from the NSR, but with respect to the NPI, it's, you know, gold price leverage as well. There was a small catch-up payment related to 2024 that we recorded in the quarter as well. So we were, we were, we were uncrewed with what we had estimated for last year. So part of that, that increase, but the bulk of it is just better production from ORLA at Des Moines and just better operations and then obviously the leverage to the gold price. So just going forward, I mean it's 7.7 this quarter. Should I think if these gold prices are the same and costs remain the same, everything's the same. It should be more like 6 million a quarter. Is that reasonable? You had 1.5 catch-up or does ballpark what might it be? I think, I think four questions. Thank you, Daniel, for their questions on the phone line. I'll turn Q&A session over to Candida Hayden who will take questions from the webcast. Thank you, Joanna. Our first question comes from Lyle Green, a shareholder of the company. precious metals prices have been a strong tail win this quarter. Could you outline the assumed price environment underpinning your guidance and how sensitive your outlook is to a gold and silver price fluctuation? Also, are there any thresholds or scenarios under which asset allocation or hedging strategies might shift? Sure. So Sandy, the pricing that we used for the guidance that we've given is $3,250 gold price and a $37 silver price. In terms of sensitivity, a $100 increase in the price of gold essentially results in about 4,700 geos lower for the other commodities when converting to geos. And with respect to hedging, we do not hedge. So we sell our gold as far. Our next question is from Lyle Green as well. What are the financial and strategic implications for Franken Nevada if the COBRA Panama asset remains offline into 2026? And how are you adjusting your portfolio risk exposure reporting phase? Well, thanks for your question. As you'll recall, when COBRA was shut down, we had impaired the asset fully. So we haven't built it into our guidance that it would be coming online in the near term. We're very hopeful that the company will be able to find a resolution with the government that would see the mine come back into the operation. But it's all upside to us. We consider it the biggest free option that you can get in the royalty and streaming industry is investing in Franco and the option of COBRA coming back. We're not dependent on it in any way. We have an extremely robust portfolio. We've got the most diversified portfolio in the space. So we look forward to COBRA coming back online, but it's all upside. The next question is from Bernie P.G. from Palisid Capital. Putting the last two quarters together, our pattern seems to be emerging. One, more aggressive business development M&A. Two, less interest in non-purchase metals. Three, greater focus on North America. Is this the result of an over-strategy shift? Good question. Is there a strategy shift? No, and maybe to reiterate, what is our overall strategy? We want to be the go-to gold stock. That means at any point in time, we want to be looking to add gold assets. That means through the cycle, adding gold assets. As you go through the cycle, you do want to have a gut sense of where you are in the cycle or you're in the top-off cycle or you're in the bottom-half of the cycle. You want to keep adding gold assets through the cycle. Where do you want to spend a lot of money? That's at the bottom of the cycle. Gold has done very well. We're keen to keep adding gold. These prices, the key is you want to get into quality assets that are again lost for long-term so that you can participate as the gold price appreciates over many decades. Hopefully, what you see in all the deals that we've done is a real focus on long-dated quality gold assets as we go through the cycle. A diversification strategy is also unchanged and the summary of it is it's opportunistic for diversified assets. It does a great asset from the market. Like the royalty we have on bar-lays, iron ore operations where they just are. Some of the best iron ore bodies in the world those assets come along will buy them. The other is if you have a downturn in industry and you can get a really good entry point into those commodities. It's strategy. We don't have to do it. We're just patient. We do it where we can get good value. More of the deals that have come out in the mix is as a function of what it was available to us. Thank you, Paul.
