In the second half of the year, our voice interaction system, built-out large-language models, will be deployed across FX Super 1 and other models. These models will connect seamlessly with the full FF ecosystem of intelligence services, delivering a deeply interactive user ecosystem. We have launched the pilot production face of the FX Super 1 and equipment installation expected to be completed with this year to enable vehicle manufacturing capability.

Thank you. Now let's welcome YT. Yes, thank you, Matias. Hi, welcome to FFNU 919 event. Today we have major milestones to announce also earlier today, thanks to all your support. All core proposals are the name change were approved at the special stockholders' meeting. On the EAI flywheel, last year, on 919, we unveiled our second brand FX. The FX Super 1 achieved a key milestone on July 17th with its first global product launch. Keeping us on track for the first week of prototypes had already undergone localization and modifications. By end of October, we will host the Super 1 Middle East final launch, where the first delivery is backed to begin in November. Today, we unveiled the FX Super 1s ultra-wide dual-screen display. A truly remarkable event is located for both driver and front passenger. Balancing, driving, and entertainment, powered by the EAI ring and unparalleled EAI space. In next generation, Super AI intelligent cabin that runs on the crypto flywheel, on August 16th, we launched our crypto strategy, completed about 10 million in crypto access allocations. As of 6PM, I realized the gain of around 7% of the platforming the Satan index overall. Most notably, our 20% activity may officially announce that the FFAI is making a strategic investment in NASDAQ-listed company QIOGN. We will start a full partnership in crypto business. After completing the required approval process, QIOGN will be rebranded as CXC10. The latter is CX, and Satan is then for one of the three growth engines of the company. The first C stands for the crypto ecosystem tokens. Next, the CXC10 company will fully focus down is three growth engines in crypto, and you can see web2 and web3, and well as AI and crypto. Next investment is led by FFAI, myself, together with other strategic investors, including Sun Foundation. With Darkwood's approval and other closing conditions, the total investment will be over 41 million US dollars. Subject to the final closing amount, Jerry won, also participated in the financing. FFAI will invest about 30 million and receive CXC10, about 55% of the current shares in QIOGN. I will personally invest four million and receive a budget and I thank them for their support. As a cornerstone investor, I would voluntarily lock up my shares for two years. After the investment is complete, FFAI and I would guide the whole 62% in the company. All of these percentages above are based on shares outstanding on the price data and giving pro-format impact to the transaction. FFAI will gradually start to send management team to lead the relevant business activities. I will also serve as the chief advisor for QIOGN, and I have a global president, Jerry won, will also serve as the co-CEO. After the transaction is complete, also is approved at the stock of the medium, which we already have the majorities to four of the seven C's. This strategically investment marks the fast landing of our dual-flow wheel and dual-breed eco-strategy. It generates three key values. First, after the investment, FFAI and the CXC10 company, our EAI flywheel and crypto flywheel will be able to operate independently and empower each other better and faster. This will conduction work. Together, they will unleash the mass of potential and help maximize value for both AI will be able to stay more focused on EAI. Crypto will open the door for EAI to enter AI ecosystem. This will include EAI product sales after sales service user operations and so on. Through RWA, real-world assets, we will create a new value for the EAI business. Thirdly, after necessary approvals, CXC10 company is expected to raise funds for its business completely on its own. This means we will no longer need to dilute FFAI shares for financing and at the same time bring the core value of CXC10 at the listed company into the FFAI lesson system in the future. Through dividends and share value growth, the returns and ecosystem empowerment created by sales citizens to support the EAI flywheel. The target is to form a value creation model for our stockholders that features positive return with zero crypto-based dilution. The two flywheels will object independently while also empower each other. Looking ahead, CXC10 will drive its business with the six key products of the three growth, it covers the three products, Satan treasury, Satan index and the planned Satan ETFs. The second growth engine is by the trade, the AI agent. The hub of users and value is the core product and an AI agent of the mother exchange that ensures users achieve the best trading paths and outcomes. The third growth engine is ecosystem tokens. The carrier of value maximization it covers two key products, the Satan stablecoin and the EAI plus crypto dual bridge RWA product. I believe that in these products gradually come to life. FFAI will truly become a company driven by dual flywheel, synergy and dual bridge empowerment, connecting EAI with crypto and bridging YB2 with YB3. I know that some of you may still have concerns about currency first appeared. Its value and significance were also not well understood. Today, DJ2 currency had already become a core and essential part of the modern financial system. Finally, I would like to announce an important personal decision. I will establish my second 50% of the equity incentive I received upon becoming co-CO as well as half of any returns from my $4 million investment. After repayment, the loan principle and related interest, this trust will be used to repay my debt under the IEV business. Although my debt has already been legally resolved in the U.S., now the details of the trust establishment, abrasion and execution. A promise made will be a promise kept. Thank you, everyone. Now let's welcome Anthony, the speaker and returns of California State Assembly. Thank you, everyone. This is California's speaker emeritus, Anthony Rinden. Congratulations to FFAI on its strategic investment in NASDAQ-listed Quality and Therapeutics Inc. The company will be renamed CXE10 and will comprehensively expand into the crypto three growth engines businesses and the Web3 ecosystem with the goal of becoming the first U.S. listed company to integrate Web2 plus Web3 and EAI plus crypto. This investment marks the accelerated implementation of FFAI's dual flywheel and dual bridge eco strategy, enabling EAI and crypto, Web2 and Web3 to operate independently, yet empower each other, thereby creating a shareholder value logic of zero dilution positive return. The success of CXE10 eloquently demonstrates that under the clear framework of California's digital financial assets law, cutting edge digital financial innovations can develop and comply the industries and powered by artificial intelligence, the company represents a direct outcome of California's future industrial strategy. CXE10 will attract as a global hub of innovation.

It underscores that supporting the real economy through industrial policy while guiding digital finance and global leadership in the 21st century. The CEO of QLGN, so he's going to tell you a little bit about the partnership as well. Dear guests, friends and valued partners from FF. Good day, everyone. I'm Kevin Richardson, CEO of Qualigent Therapeutics. It's a great honor to be here today as we officially announce a strategic investment from Faraday Future in the beginning of a comprehensive collaboration between our two companies. This partnership marks more than just a capital alliance. It's a shared vision for the future of digital innovation. As we stand at the forefront of a new technology that driving forces behind global transformation, we will fully be committed to building out the three chain application ecosystem. Together with this, we will focus on developing a robust, open and scalable Web3 ecosystem that fosters innovation, security and user empowerment. This partnership with FFAI brings not only strategic resources and synergy but also accelerates our presence in the U.S. capital markets. Moving forward, Qualigent will sharpen a strategic focus, strengthen its technical capabilities and embrace an open ecosystem approach as we strive toward our goal of becoming a leading public company in the Web3 sector in the United States. Personally, I hold a deep conviction, collaborate and organize as a society. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the FFAI team for their trust and support and to all our employees and partners for their hard work and dedication. The future is already here and the pace of change is only accelerating. Together, let us seize this moment Thank you. And greetings everyone. My name is Jerry Wang. I'm the global president of FFAIi Future. We're very glad to announce the strategic partnership plus investment with our great partner QLGN. And I'd like to share a little bit more on our crypto related strategy. With our strategic partnership with QLGN, the three growth engines, strategic planning of the crypto business and the six key products roadmap are gradually coming into view. Yet, this is the only the tip of our broader vision. Today, I want to take this opportunity to present our overall plan to investors, stockholders and fellow futures. Well, the first engine is our C10. C10 is our value anchor in our ecosystem. It's the cornerstone of our confidence, the part that anchors the long term value. Treasure guided strictly by the C10 index allocated 80% passively and 20% actively. Second, is our C10 index. It is the first top-term crypto asset index ever launched by a U.S. list company, setting a new benchmark for the market. We will also apply for C10 fund and ETF license proactively. The second engine is best trade, the nexus of users and value in our ecosystem. For now, I cannot disclose technical details too much regarding best trade for confidentiality reasons, but what I can share is its strategic positioning, best trade value. The third engine is our ecosystem tokens, the engine for maximizing the value of our ecosystem. This is where value is captured and set into circulation. It's made up of two components. First is EI plus crypto dual bridge real-world asset, RWA product. One end, it connects to FFAI's industrial data, energy network and user activity. The other connects to the vast digital financial world. The second will be our C10 that will provide a rock solid medium of exchange across the entire ecosystem. Now, C10 and tokens is just like roots and branches. The C10 treasure provides the solid backing that ensures tokens and stablecoins are not castles in the air. The tokens in return circulate and multiply. Next up, the relationship between best trade and tokens. It's just like the engine and fuel. It creates a cycle, finally, the relationship between the best trade, the AI engine and C10 is one of roles and reinforcement. Best trade, the AI agent as our super gateway will attract massive user engagement and capital inflows. This inflow will rapidly expand the scale of our C10 treasure. In return, a stronger C10 treasure will evaluate the credibility and strength of our entire ecosystem. To build a truly trusted ecosystem, we must partner with the architects of that trust. That's why I'm thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with Sine, the leading team building the critical world-class investors like Sequoia and Binance Labs. So, specifically, Sine leads the web3 industry in two core directions, token distribution and verification. The partnership between C10, CX, CX, and Sine centers on advancing EAI innovation and leveraging digital assets to accept. Thanks, Jerry. That concludes the presentations and speeches for the night, but don't leave, all right? We got a few other things. First, we're going to call up all the speakers to do a quick photo op. If you guys have questions for either of them, now is your time to ask. So, give us a second to set up for some photos, and then we'll do the Q&A session. So, don't leave. Guy. Yeah, just a reminder. English only. Sorry. We got to mention that. Sorry about you. Those we get to you guys want to say it or you want to say it?
