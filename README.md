Bertraman, our co-founder and CEO, as well as Marcus Boser, our CFO. I'm also very pleased to welcome Christian Valentine, who will be succeeding Marcus in stepping into the role of CFO effective January 1, 2026. We will start with the presentation followed as always by questions and answers. If you would like to ask a question, please raise it by the usual Zoom Q&A tool at the bottom of your screen. We will then call on you to ask your question directly after the presentation. Before I hand over to Christian, I must make you aware of the safe harbor provisions at the beginning of the presentation here. These will apply to any forward-looking statements made by management today, and now over to you Christian. Thank you, Philip. Hi, everyone. Welcome to this other one group Q3 earnings call. Our business performance in the third quarter has been very strong. We saw 219,000 vehicles. This is a new quarterly record and an increase of 24% year-on-year. Total Cross Profits surged by 38% year-on-year to 258 million euro. This is 71 million euro more than in Q3 of last year. We grew adjusted EBITDA from 34 million in Q3 of 24 to 52 million euro this year, representing a 51% increase. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 2.4% that is 30 basis points of increase compared to last year and the highest Q3 margin we ever achieved. These great results reflect the effectiveness of our strategy, our discipline and targeted investments in key areas, strong execution and above all, the dedication of our teams. We are pursuing a value-first strategy across all segments. We are strongly focusing on the drivers that create value for all of our customers. While we have been executing this strategy since our foundation, we constantly take steps forward in understanding our customers' needs, expectations and priorities even better, resulting in superior demand levels across segments. Value in our business can mean higher setting prices, lower buy prices, lower processing costs, greater selection, greater convenience, highly motivated staff, increased trust, fast and reliable delivery and competitive financing. Let's start our deep dive with the merchant performance update for the third quarter. In Q3, we sold 192,000 vehicles to our partner dealers. This is a new all-time quarterly record and represents a 22% year-on-year unit increase. We also generated a record merchant plus profit of 185 million euro for Q3, increasing by 29% year-on-year. With GPU was 966 euro, a 6% increase compared to Q3 of last year. We sold 550,000 merchant units in the first nine months of 25, that is 22% more compared to the same period last year. Gross profit increased by 125 million euro to 535 million compared to the first nine months of 24, a 31% increase. The strong growth in our merchant segment is driven by constantly rising demand for our B2B offering. This momentum is reflected in yet another record-breaking quarter for the number of merchants buying on Auto1.com. For the first time ever, we surpassed 30,000 active merchant buyers, reaching 31,100 in the increase compared to Q3 of last year. Our average basket size per merchant remains stable year-on-year with each merchant purchasing an average of 6.2 vehicles per quarter. We are very happy with these strong results while we continue to expand our buyer base further. Auto1 merchant financing delivered another strong quarter as well. We continued the successful rollout of our financing solution for partner dealers expanding into Poland and Q3 and most recently launching Sweden just a few weeks ago. Our merchant financing portfolio grew by 60% year-on-year, increasing from 178 million euro last year to 284 million euro for the third quarter. We financed 359 million euro of merchant sales, a growth of 63% year-on-year, and the number of vehicles financed through to 33,000 units, a 65% increase compared to Q3 of last year. We continued to be very excited about Auto1 financing and plan to bring it to even more markets and partners in the future. Our sourcing network expansion continues to go very well, too. We opened 42 new branches in the third quarter and closed the quarter with 690 drop-off locations across Europe. Growing our drop-off network increases convenience for our selling customers and increases selection for our partner dealers. Now we will take a look at retail, which had a very strong quarter as well. In the third quarter, our retail business grew strongly in unit sales, in GPU, and in total gross profit. Auto-hero delivered a rare core 27,000 units compared to 19,100 in Q3 of last year, an accelerated increase of 42% year-on-year and a reflection of our ambition to build a bigger business faster. We generated the highest ever retail cost profit of €73 million, growing significantly by 68% year-on-year. Retail GPU was €2,664 in Q3, representing an increase of 18% compared to Q3 of last year and setting a new record. Q3 retail GPU was positively impacted by a €2 million one-off benefit. In the first nine months, gross profit increased by €76 million to €190 million and GPU increased by €490 compared to the same period of last year. If we take a look at production, we continue to expand our production center footprint across Europe in the third quarter. We announced three new production centers located in Italy, in Austria, and in Netherlands, bringing our total to 12 centers across 10 different markets. With these facilities, our total production capacity has increased by 38%, rising from 179,000 to 248,000 cars per year at full utilization. Collectively, the three new facilities span a total of 184,500 square meters and have a combined annual production capacity of 71,500 cars at full utilization. Our new facility in the Netherlands is already operational and we expect the locations in Austria and Italy to open before the end of this year. Today, approximately 95% of all auto-hero cars are refurbished in our own use car production centers. By operating our own facilities, we maintain full control over every step of the process, which remains a key driver for car quality and optimizing unit economics while we support the continued growth of auto-hero. We are constantly building out our fulfillment network for auto-hero across Europe to speed up delivery and increase comfort for our retail customers. We aim to provide our customers with the fastest delivery of their new car at great rates or in many cases already for free. We aim to build our network in a way that supports this effort as best as possible, supporting pickup or home delivery depending on our customers' preferences. We were able to reduce the average delivery time from just under 12 days in Q3 of last year to 9.5 days this year. That means we deliver 20% faster year on year. Finally, let's take a look at our long-term goals. Our unique vertically integrated business model is providing the foundation for our future growth and margin expansion. We aim to capture a market share of 10% of the European use car transactions in the long run and combine this volume with 5% to 9% of adjusted EBITDA margin depending on the relative size of the merchant and the retail business. With total units growing 24% year on year and EBITDA margin improving by more than 14% quarter on quarter to 2.4% of Q3 results mark an important further step towards both long-term targets. They are also demonstrating first and early returns of the increased investments we made since Q2 of this year. Most of those investments, however, particularly the increased investment into the auto-hero brand building are strategic multi-quarter investments that strengthen our market position and drive long-term value and margin expansion in the future. We expect the full impact of these efforts to become increasingly evident in a quarter and years ahead as our vertically integrated business continues to scale. I'll now hand over to Marcus for a detailed financial update. Thanks, Christian. Q3 represented yet another record for us in terms of units and with 219,000 units sold beat our previous quarterly record by over 7% as well as achieving 24% year on year growth on a group-wide basis. It also represents the first time that we broke the 2 billion euro barrier for revenue achieved in a quarter. We're definitely back in growth mode. We achieved this growth with record group GPUs at 1,176, reflecting the mix effect from the higher GPUs in our retail business as its higher growth at over 42% in units means it becomes a larger portion of our business. We also incurred 206 million in optics to support this growth resulting in a adjusted EBITDA of 51.9 million and a net income of 19.2 million. If we go through our op-x quarter over quarter, we have been investing to accelerate our growth and increase the moat around our business so that we can grow to a bigger business faster to reap the scale effects once we get there. Gross profit has grown by 38%, the majority of which has been a result of higher units. Over time, higher units also help drive higher GPUs as the more data we receive, the better we can price cars that we see on both the merchant and retail parts of the business. We increased marketing by 7.6 million, of which the overwhelming majority was an auto-hero marketing as we invest to create a strong pan-European brand while the cost of WKDA marketing per purchase car has been steadily declining. Likewise, we see positive scale effects across both logistics with only 1.6 million increase as well as payroll with 2.2 million in additional costs despite significant quarter over quarter and year over year growth. Moving to the balance sheet, we maintain a strong balance sheet, increasing cash with no corporate debt. Total cash increased quarter over quarter to 628 million as a result of increased profitability and the public securitization of our consumer loans which we conducted in September. We continue to build inventory to support our growth with 870 million at the end of Q3. By way of reminder, 80% of the inventory and its growth is financed through our inventory ABS. Lastly, we continue to invest in our capital finance assets with quarterly growth of circus 76 million consisting of 20 million growth in the merchant loan portfolio and 55 million growth in our consumer loan portfolio. The growth in both portfolios are a reflection of the ongoing growth in sales of both our merchant and retail units. In September, we issued our second public securitization finance 0-2 of our consumer portfolio. This was a unique transaction that combined consumer loans from both Germany and Austria, the first ever public auto ABS combining assets from different countries. This transaction enables us to both increase the loan to value on the portfolio as well as achieve a reduction in our net interest margin with a blended spread of 87 basis points. This transaction further represents significant validation of the quality of our consumer loan or consumer finance portfolio. Lastly, we come to guidance. We are increasing our expectation for merchant units from 680 to 720,000 to 715 to 745,000 units for 2025, representing 19% year on year growth at the midpoint and our expectations of auto-hero units from 92 to 97,000 units to 96 to 100,000 units for the full year, representing 32% year on year growth at the midpoint. Together, this results in 811 to 845,000 units from the group. We expect that we can maintain this increased growth in retail at a GPU of around 2500 as Q3 retail GP had a small one-off effect. With respect to merchant GPU, while we continue to be confident in the long-term upside, our 2025 guidance assumes it will be around 950 for Q4. Together, this leads to increase our gross profit range to 940 to 975 million up from 890 to 940 million our previous guidance. We believe that we will continue our current level of op-ex spend, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA guidance of 180 to 195 million for the full year up from 160 to 190 million guided previously. As I mentioned previously, Q4 is generally the quarter with the highest volatility as dealers tend to slow down their purchases as we approach the end of the year, the extent of which is hard to predict. While we normally make no comment on the forward year until we are in that year, I'd like to make a few comments to frame our thinking for 2026 in light of the extraordinary growth that we've achieved at our previous commentary. Last year at this time, we believe that merchant would grow in the high single digits, and clearly we've been able to out-achieve this. We believe that we can continue to grow merchant in the low to mid teens over the next year while achieving marginal improvements in GPU year over year. In AutoHero, we aim to achieve 25 to 30 percent growth next year on our updated 2025 guidance, reflecting the strong growth and progress that we're achieving this year, as well as ongoing marginal improvements in GPU. With respect to op-ex, our baseline assumption is that our op-ex per unit will be similar to the circa 940 euros per unit we achieved in Q2 and Q3, though this may edge higher if we achieve much higher auto-hero growth than mentioned. We see an incredible underexploited opportunity in front of us and believe these increased investments by merrily in auto-hero marketing will enable us to achieve our long-term 5 to 9 percent to reach the scale benefits in logistics, tech invest, branding, procurement, and operations. In the meantime, we will compensate this additional investment through higher profitable merchant unit growth, so that overall, we believe that we can maintain the current consensus adjusted ePTA expectations for 2026. Before we move into the Q&A session, I'd like to take a moment to share a few personal reflections. As you know, this will be my final earnings call a CFO of auto-one group as I will be stepping down at the end of the year after 10 truly memorable years. It's been an extraordinary journey from our early days as a startup to becoming a publicly listed company and building a business that is not only financially robust but also incredibly positioned for sustainable, profitable growth in a huge market. I'm deeply grateful for the trust and support I receive from Christian, Hakan, our supervisory board, our customers, partners, the entire auto-one group team, and all of you on this call. Thank you for your collaboration and partnership throughout my tenure. Starting January 1st, Christian Valentin will be stepping in a CFO. Since early October, we've been working together closely to ensure a seamless transition. Christian brings a wealth of financing experience to the team, and I'm genuinely excited to watch both Christians lead auto-one group into its next chapter. Christian Valentin joins us on the call today, and I would now like to hand it over to him for a brief introduction. Thank you very much, Marcus. Hi everyone, it's a pleasure to join you on this call. I'm truly excited to be part of Alt-O-1 Group's Management Board and to take up the role of CFO at the beginning of next year. Working a long time, Marcus and Christian the past few weeks have only reinforced my enthusiasm for this opportunity. I'm very much impressed by the discipline forward thinking way the business is managed, and I'm most importantly very thrilled by the significant opportunities that lie ahead. With over 20 years of experience in banking and finance, I look forward to contributing to eight auto-ones journey and driving growth and profitability together with Christian and the entire team. With that, we are very happy to open now the floor for your questions. Before we begin with the Q&A portion of today's call, I'd like to go over a few brief technical points. If you haven't already, please feel free to submit your question using the Q&A tool located at the bottom of your Zoom screen. If it will call participant interns, once your name is announced, I will unmute your line and end over the floor to you. I'm sure that your microphone is enabled and that you're ready to speak when printed. Our next question will come from Jamie State. Please unmute your line. Thank you. Good afternoon. It's James Tate from Goldman. I've got two questions, please. I guess firstly, you touched upon the strategic shift towards growth of the past couple quarters and you've already started to deliver an acceleration in units growth and the color on next year is very helpful. You commented on total group OPEX per unit sold being at the same level as Q3, but I guess within the mix, how should you think about auto-segment profitability specifically? Do you expect to order either either our loss per car to stay stable at current levels or perhaps slightly worsen into next year as you increase your investment? And then secondly, on inventory, notice that I grew 60 million euros quarter on quarter. Could you give some colour on which segment drove this growth? Was it more skewed to auto-hero or merchant? And then last year, you flagged that you're particularly aggressive in purchasing and building inventory in Q4. So should we expect a similar strategy this year? Thank you. Michael, do you want to go ahead on the segment possibility? As we've talked about in the past, auto-hero on an adjusted EBITDA or segment basis is still a loss-making segment. Having said that, we believe that overall, those losses are relatively small in the growth opportunity in front of us. We also see improving unit economics, except in marketing, where we continue to invest precisely because we want to grow that business. And really, as we talked about, accelerate the growth of that business as we've been able to do so far. I think going forward, I would say overall, I think a lot of those improvements in overall unit economics, I think we would expect to continue, which is, I think, why we're happy to have the existing topics cost per unit delivered to remain the same, even as we grow and have basically kind of given accelerated growth. So I think don't see that dramatically changing. Obviously, the more scale we get, I think, the improvements we're going to continue to see, and certainly want to see them because we really want to get to the point where we have the scale, where we start really seeing dramatic improvements across brand data, ability to use AI, a lot of logistics items that we've talked about, that we can really get the benefit of scale. So we want to invest now so we can see an expansion and an improvement in those unit economics in the coming years. But I think 2026 is going to be one where we're going to see steady objects per unit, as we've seen for the past two quarters. I think your second question on inventory, I would say the growth that we've seen kind of into Q2 and Q3 has been more on the retail side than on the merchant side. I think we generally only kind of in the half of the report and the full report is I think when you get a full breakdown of it, I think in Q3, we tend not to, but we've really seen, as we continue to invest in retail, and retail obviously has longer days outstanding, we're growing that relative to merchant much more. Thanks, ma'am. I think there was a third question on Q4, maybe Christian, you want to talk about it about Q4 strategy. Yeah, in general, I would say we will follow James like a similar strategy. I think inventory in merchant is in great shape, especially if we look at the trajectory from Q2 to Q3, and then in retail, we're building up selection for further growth, because that needs to go hand in hand with this elevated brand build out and elevated amount of session, visitor session growth that we see in burn at lamp from UBS. Our next question comes from draw burn at lamp, please unmute your line. Our next question comes from draw burn at lamp, please unmute your line. Maybe a sir Joe doesn't seem to be able to connect. I think he had a couple of questions. One was how he should think about merchant GPU into Q4 and then into 2026, and then he wanted to know in merchant, he said the upper end of the merchant guidance implies 21% year over year growth in merchant cars in 2025, and can we share any color about 2026? Can we deliver double digit growth in 2026? And then also a question on auto hero GPU, given that we are almost 2.7 thousand euros, do we still think that the long term guidance of 3000 euros GPU and auto hero holds? Yeah, maybe I'll take those. I mean, I think my prepared remarks answered all those questions, or I would hope so, but so I would simply repeat, I think for Q4, we are expecting round about the 950 as we talked about euros for merchant GPU. It's talked about Q4 is always a very volatile quarter because of the kind of dealer behavior as we go into the end of the year. And likewise, we would expect some improvements of that into next year. So I think some, but I have more marginal kind of improvements as we go into next year. Likewise, can we deliver double digit growth in merchant? I think, again, talked about low to mid teens growth in the merchant business for next year. And I believe, yeah, we can do that while while having some improvement in merchant GPU. Lastly, I think on to our, if I understood the last question, our long term guidance of 3000 very much still holds. As again, as we talked about, I think into 2026, I believe that we can continue to see marginal improvements in auto hero GPU. But I think all the drivers that we have talked about in the past, around really speeding up sales, faster turns, again, more finance, reduced costs. I think all still stand. And I think we feel very comfortable with the 3000 euro GPU that we can achieve that. Thanks, Marcus. And with that, Andrew Ross from Barclays. Our next question, our next question comes from Andrew Ross. Please unmute your line and ask your question. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Okay. Yes. Yeah. Perfect. I've got three of us. Okay. The first one is to slide a bit more into the extra brand marketing that's been going in in my last couple of quarters and you're assuming it's going to continue. Can you give us like a couple of numbers around the metrics that you track around the payback of our brand marketing to give us comfort that you're definitely getting the returns. But you would expect, I don't know how you think about that, but you know, it would be helpful for us to try and quantify that in a bit more detail. I mean, as you kind of think about that payback model into 2026, what are you kind of assuming continues? Because on the face of it, there seems to be quite a lot of brand investment that's embedded in your outlook for 26, but then only an inverted comma is 25 to 30% unit growth retail. So just kind of what's the trade off between those two numbers and how could retail be better, I guess? And then the third question is for, I guess, both Marcus and Christian Barrington. And by his, you know, a bigger picture question about the financing of the balance sheet and your attitude to kind of keeping consumer receivables on the balance sheet, longer term as my business gets more material versus, you know, the option of potentially selling them off to third parties at some point down the road, would be curious as to how you see that over medium term. Thanks. Yeah, thank you, Andrew. Yeah, of course, we're checking a couple of metrics and cannot go into all details here. But for instance, of course, we're checking a brand health stats. So brand awareness, brand consideration, also brand image. So that's one part of it where we are really double checking how we are we building the brand into a more known brand into the leading pan-European brand for selling used cars that we drive to be. And at the same time, we're also looking at performance data, which, yeah, ranges from instance, from sessions that we see on the platform into kind of lead generation. So how many people are interested in the car, obviously looking at the different channels and the non-brand channels. We're looking at financing shares that people ask for and then finally get. And the level of brand advertising that we're spending here, you can think of on the one hand, let's say maybe 40 to 50% of having a more direct effect into the quarter and then 50 to 60% being a multi-quarter cohort payback. And obviously, we're tracking also the cohorts and harder paying back. But that's why it's a ramp game. It's building a base, some customers deciding quickly and some others are in the market for six to nine months or even longer. And it's about to build penetration into both of these segments over time. And that's why we feel quite comfortable with the stats that we have given that level of investment. So is there further upside? There might be. But I think it would not make sense to commit to that right now because we need to see the performance as we go. I think maybe I'll start with the second question, which is with respect to our consumer loan strategy. I think we've, I think in a sense, always been open to kind of whether we have it on balance sheet or opportunistically look whether or not there are other structures who would have it off balance sheet. I think so far, we're still relatively early in that in that journey. This is only our second public securitization while we continue to also go into some new markets. So I think we've never in a way kind of said that we wouldn't want to do the other one, but I think haven't quite seen a structure or pricing that would really work for us. But maybe Christian, if you want to say, you know, a few words, obviously, you've only been here for a few weeks. So it's maybe I would say a little bit immature, pretty mature to put you on the spot. But clearly, you know, you have a huge amount of experience in the space. So I think would, I think be good to people who are positioned on it. Absolutely. So thank you, Marcus. And thank you for the question. So I mean, the public securitizations are a robust funding source with a good risk profile as well. And given the pricing of these structures, it's difficult to match as a funding source. So I would see ourselves continue with this and maybe then building scale quick for these securitizations and doing them more regularly. But that remains to be seen. But clearly, I mean, in general, I mean, I'm new. So I will review most things and understand many things as we go over the next few quarters. So so I don't see any reason to have any news on this. But clearly, I mean, I come from a banking sector and I like having a diversified funding structure. But no, no news on that as it as a robust funding source. Thank you. And with this over to Nisla and Azia from Deutsche Bank. Our next question comes from Nisla Niza. Please unmute your line and ask your question. Great. I hope you can hear me. Let me start off by saying all the best to you, Marcus, and it's been great working with you. So thank you for all your time in the past and I hope wish you all the best. And Kristin, looking forward to working with you going forward as well. I have three questions from my end. Firstly, could you just maybe give us some colors to how the overall use car market performed in Europe and when you think of your own business in merchant and retail where there's certain geographies that were performing better than others in terms of growth, some color that would be great. And secondly, I mean, the step up in your merchant customer numbers is quite meaningful from Q2 to Q3. Was there a push in some geographies over others or what really drove that level of growth in the customers that you're seeing on the merchant side? And my last question, I think, Marcus, you mentioned that when it came to WKDA marketing, the marketing cost per acquired car has been decreasing quite meaningfully, but you are sourcing more cars. So just wanted to understand what's helping here and in this world where people are worried about sort of traffic coming from AI. How are you seeing your sort of online traffic sources evolving and do you not see this as a risk or is it an opportunity? Some color there would be great. Thank you. Thank you, Disla. So yeah, in terms of use car market overall environment, I think we are in a more or less stable environment. And yeah, nearly all of the growth that we are realizing here is homemade and drives up to corresponding market share. We will announce our official annual market share then during the next quarterly call, which I think is scheduled for some time in February. Overall, we see, yeah, with some variations, pretty much all of our geographies growing. So it's not one market and one area or region in particular that makes up this growth. Obviously, there's some shifts here and there where merchants can substitute certain inventory, also through other markets inventory and then there's a shift but overall operating a very efficient market platform. And then I think just to correctly understand the second question, it was about the growth in merchant bias that we had reported. Or did I get this wrong? Yeah, I think the question also we saw a particular push in particular markets where that was fairly universal growth. Yeah, I think similar to my comments around the use car market, we didn't see particular segments where we had over average growth or other areas where we reduced so we're investing into all demand basis in all markets. And yeah, you can see that this goes fairly well. Again, in Q3. And then on WKDA sourcing cost per unit, markets maybe you want to start it and I can finish? Yeah, I mean, I think overall, I mean, you said meaningfully, I think what the point I was trying to make, they have come down but almost all or a huge percentage of the increase in marketing is really coming from auto hero. And I think broadly, that reduction I think is sort of a validation of our strategy, both in terms of just getting more efficient branch growth and just getting better on the purchasing side. And that will continue to flow through also for things like retail, unit economics. Yeah, so I think that was the commentary on the reduction of purchase side spend. And maybe Christian, you can talk about kind of AI and impact thereof. Yeah, so I mean, well, for instance, on the on the CW side, we have built out, built out very strong brands, very strong brand awareness with us a decade and more. Nevertheless, I mean, a high frequency advertising setup across all the different channels. And we are for the moment not seeing that in our setup, AI has any negative impact. Of course, we see, I think like most of the companies, a little bit lower SEO traffic than what maybe has been there like two years ago. But yeah, we're able to more than compensate that through other channels, you can see that in the results. And for us, it's more an opportunity because also if we speak about selling, but also about, as well, of course buying cost and yeah, we have the unique chance to position ourselves in the respective AI platforms to the customer. And we are starting to look into how to best do this, which is kind of how I would call it the new SEO that is coming up. And it's something that is in motion, but we're looking into this while we grow the business. Thank you. And with that too, Wolfgang Specht from Birnberg. Our next questions come from Wolfgang Specht. Please unmute your line. Yes, hello. Good afternoon. Two additional from my end. First on your refurbishing capacities, the 248 probably means you got to run two or probably three shifts in at least some of the centers. Is that right? And then related to that, that would mean you got to work with a broader workforce. Is it possible or let's say payable to onboard new mechanics in the amount you need them for the growth next year? And then on bet debt expenses, have there been any changes to the figures you told us recently or is it just stable? I thank you Wolfgang. Yeah, I'm production. I mean, to go to the full 248 a produced volume per annum would indeed require, I think, some of the centers have two shifts. I think some of the centers that we operate already have two shifts. So it's not something that we experiment new. So we don't have a center that has three shifts or without operating a night shift, but we're operating a morning and an afternoon shift in some of the centers. And that has proven to go quite well after some initial learning time, obviously, because it's about the handover of the unfinished cars between the two shifts. And yeah, as we also continue to express over the, I think, last couple of quarters, this is one of the hardest roles to hire. The mechanics for Europe, I think the team has proven to be able to achieve the high numbers that we need. Do we need more than we currently have? Yes. Would this be a further cost benefit to auto euro if we were able to start up fully? Yes, because some of the roles are filled with temporary workers at the moment, which are, of course, far more expensive. But I think we're on a good track there. We're learning better and better how to fill up those roles. But this is also one point where auto euro profitability has still a good amount of upside. And then with respect to bad debt, there hasn't been any changes. So both on the consumer and the merchant side, it's been consistent over the last few quarters. Thank you, Marcus. And that concludes our Q&A session and the earnings call for Q3 2025. I think as most of you know, we have quite an active IR program for the next week. So hopefully, we'll see quite a lot of you in Madrid next week or subsequently in Barcelona, or then in way bridge with Baron back. So thank you very much and hopefully see you soon. Thank you so much, everyone. Take care. Thank you.
