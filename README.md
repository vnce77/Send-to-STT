Good afternoon, investors, and welcome to the AAC Technologies 2012-2015 Interim Presales announcement conference. I'm the host of this event, Joyce Wong, Director of Investor Relations at AAC Technologies. First, on behalf of the company, I would like to thank you for all your interesting AACs. Please allow me to introduce the company management in present today. Mr Benjamin Pan, Executive Director and the CDO of AAC Technologies. Mr Kelvin Pan, Executive Vice President of AAC Tech. Mr Jack Duan, Chairman of AAC Optics. And Mr Shilting Zha. Senior Vice President of Strategy of AAC Tech, an exchange management's attendance. There's meeting in those two parts, starting with my presentation on AAC 2025 Interim Presales financial performances and basic departments. This will be followed by a QA session. You are welcome to ask your questions by pressing the raise hand button or leaving a massive, intense meeting room. You may remain the hand-raising status to remind post. Please introduce your organization and a name before questions. We also have on this channel today. And please click the interpretation button if you need. And in addition, today's meeting has set up a bilingual channel for you to switch between Chinese and English through the button. Next, I would like to present the group's results for the first half of 2025. The group's revenue achieved R&B 13.32 billion, a rapid growth of 18.4% year-on-year, which was attributed to the continuous improvement in the market share of major products, gross profits amounted to R&B 2.75 billion, an increase of 13.9% year-on-year. And the gross profit margin was 20.7%, down slightly by 0.8% of the points. From it, due to change, a product that makes revenue from the precision mechanics of picks and sensors and semiconductors grew at a faster pace. Revenue growth rate significantly outpaced our growth of SG&A expenses. That profit increased by 63.1% to 876 million, primarily due to the continued profitability improvement in optics and the rapid growth in high-marting precision mechanics. The group's revenue continued to grow, achieving both improved quality and efficiency, according to ADC data at the global smartphone-treatment volume, increased by 1.5% and is 1% in Q1 and Q2, respectively. As showing the left figure, the group's consumer-electronic related business achieved a revenue of 11.58 billion. A growth rate several times the global smartphone-treatment volume, revenue from the EMDN and optics business increased to 27.4%, and in 19.7%. The total multiple acoustics business achieved a total revenue of 1.74 billion, accounting for about 13 to 15 of the group's total revenue, in terms of gross profit margin, the optics so a significant improvement, increasing by 5.5 percentage points year-on-year. The GDP-marting for plastic lenses surged by over 10% points in the automotive sector that GDP-marting up the newly acquired company. First, light also exceeded the industry average, and the group's operating cash-inglow amounted to 2.89 billion up 9.1%, and while free cash-flow was 1.86 billion, CAPEX was 1.44 billion, increase of 57.25%, net-hearing ratio stood at 47% with cash-on-book up to 7.75 billion. The group will continue to improve its operational efficiency, and the operating cash-inglow will support the group's long-term healthy development and innovation. Next up, we'd like to share with you the performance by basis segments, acoustics. In the first half of the year, acoustics business revenue reached 3.5 billion, the year-on-year increase of 1.8%, GDP-marting was 27.2%. As a master and a co-axel, speakers continue to lead to high-end markets with the shipment exceeding 70 million units, 17 million units in the first half of the year, and the increase of nearly 40%, who also loans the industry signers to speak with the unit of the sickness of only 1.4 million meters, accompanied by the second half of the more high-end approach of the acoustic business gross margin grossed increase. Also, in the alternative acoustic business, the revenue of 1.74 billion up to 14.2% year-on-year. The beginning was 23.9%. As awarded, as you've been told, that the forward domestic and UV encompassing certain two speakers, and we also have the full stack in vehicle acoustic systems was unveiled in the Shanghai Auto Show showcasing the high-performance speakers, and also the AI music splitting on algorithm creating comprehensive acoustic experience for customers. The groups also announced the acquisition of a eBay first-light auto cars with key products put for you up a smart microphone, nickel microphones, and R&C sensors. Its smart microphones are now covering all major vehicle models for strengthening the group's presence in autonomous acoustic system solution in terms of optics, and the revenue was 2.65 billion up to 19.7% year-on-year shipment volume of both fast thicknesses and optic modules increased year-on-year, accompanied by the continued growth in AISP, and the KPI margin was 10.2% year-on-year made basic lines. Firstly, for plastic lenses, our shipment volume of a 6P and above plastic lenses exceeded 18%, with stable shipments of high specification, 7P approved acts and increased orders for mid-to-high end of plastic lenses, and secondly regarding the camera modules, AISP's further increased thanks to the rapid thickness of mid-to-high specification products, with module revenue increasing by over 20% year-on-year shipment to volume of modules with visiting to a megapixel and above a contact for over 24%, and increase of over 3% year-on-year, 108% and a main camera modules for several key engine models have entered a mass production, known as module cells exceeded 800 million, up close to 115% year-on-year. Certainly regarding fast plastic hybrid lenses, the WLT product line achieved a milestone in product development and has been widely recognized by customers. We will provide details later. Next, we will focus on the EMD and the PM. In the first half of the year, revenue from this consolidated segment increased by 27.6% to 4.63%, many due to the continued wrapping up of the products, such as excess motors, innovative side buttons and metal casing in customers mid-to-high-end models, and the PM was 22.9%. The group rapidly expanded a new business, and for example, the innovative customized groundbreaking super sling engine adjusted 2.33 millimeters a thick and a winning only 2.25 grams, and it continues to take lead in this mobile bond industry. In the field of PM, the groups in three major business segments have achieved breakthroughs. In terms of that, it is a metal casing. The group continues to maintain a high and a stable supply in customers mid-to-high-end and a folding motor, and the benefit from the market of the penetration. Regarding laptop enclosure, revenue was around 713 million in the first half, and 18.4% in your increase. Finally, let's look at the sensors and semiconductor business. In the first half, the revenue was a 608 million, 56.2% in your increase, primarily included by the largest scale of two months of the group's high-end microboles to meter overseas customers. So, this started the financial performance of each business segment, and we will start the QA session first. Let's welcome the first question, and this is from the Everbright, and mixed food. Good afternoon, management. I'm put here from Everbright and overseas. First of all, I'd like to congratulate you to the achieve months for the first half, and this is a very encouraging in terms of the revenue and the profit, and many investors also have a lot of money to do. This is a non-recurring income, and it is also made contribution to the profits. So, please explain this profit and the non-recurring income, and what's the influence for a second half. Okay, thank you very much for the first question. In terms of this non-recurring income, this is a related to the acquisition and the completion of the acquisition of the PSS. Actually, this is a value gain, and the actual price rate is lower than the previous inspection at a very reasonable price, and after we complete this transaction, and this will help us to create better synergy, and this is just a one-time adjustment into not the second half of the year. And next, I will also talk about the opportunity. As you mentioned, both in the revenue and the profitability, a very good growth trend has already been shown in the first half of the year, and the revenue for this first half of the year, the growth rate was about 18.4%, and we have the confidence that the growth rate in the second half is about 18.4%. In addition, the shipping margin is about 22.1%, and you see there are new projects on the rent and the shipping margin is also lower than the average, and with the development of this new products in the second half, we have the confidence to increase the shipping margin, and yes, last year, the shipping margin, overall, the shipping margin was 30.2%, and the last year, that's very clear. Thank you very much. And a second question is about the optics business, and optics business improvement is one of the highlights in our performance, and the last year has already achieved the positive profit. And this year, and this kind of situation has been and I'm sorry to date, but many investors are interested in this continuous development, and the WLG, they can be regarded, this year can be regarded the first year for the largest skilled mass production of WLG, so whilst you're out of the skill of profitability. I'd like to take this question. And this year, at the largest scale, a mass production, as we expected, and this will be more than 10 million. The expectation is about 15% and the growth. You also talk about the WLG, the breakeven, and the positive profitability. I think this will happen next year, and the EU, it's about WLG, it's very stable. And above 80%, and we're realizing the single lens of profitability. In a way, there's a mass production in the second half, the G plus P and hybrid lenses will be exceeded, the plastic lenses, and we'll reach about 33%. Okay, thank you. And the last question is about the strategies. And our team has followed AAC for more than 10 years. The amount of money that they sell automotive acoustics and QD full established development, and including their consumer electronics, so as well as the robotics business. I'd like to say the outlook whether there will be new company growth engine or the new profits engine in the future. Let me answer this question and first off both and we have done a lot of effort in the effort in the technology on R&D in mobile smartphone industry and consumer electronic industry and we will continue to optimize our plan in the smartphone industry in this In addition, we will also capitalize the opportunity of AI development and the microphone sensors you see from the last years has already been about 700 million and it may double this year and it is that we will be scaled up and this is the growth engine and in addition and our dissipation solutions for the overseas high-end customers and in the second half of the year and this will enter the mass production as well and last year this year was about 300 million and this year this will be tripled so in the overall AI application scenarios is a place we will make a better contribution to our productivity and with the stable smartphone and segment volume. We also see the smartphone folding challenge though it raised the amount of our same products and did this provide more opportunities for us for example we have this high performance high energy and high density products and this will help us to improve our continuous development on ESP and the way the stable development our acoustics and also the motors will record growth and those are the opportunities brought by the smartphone also we also have our global plans and of the automotive industry and last year we are quite first line and from the high-end speakers to the complete amplifier system and the core algorithm and we have the sensor of models and specific answers and autonomous automotive sectors have already accounted 10 percent of our revenue and we have already obtained a design wing for a very high-end brand in the domestic market and in this system we will redefine the filling of the domestic audio system and the system has a 13 parts requirement and this design wing skill is also very large and we will have more information for our customers and we will also continue our expansion and to the automotive on the industries and to the Apple status system on the brand expansion and the longer run we will also see the opportunity of AI also for example the robotics and there's a lot of the motors inside and we are preparing our plan in this regard in the next two years AI and they are we our devices will provide opportunities and apart from the wearables we will be more like demand enemies and then we are proactively discussing with our customers overseas and domestically and in the future maybe there will be some independent AI devices directly connected to some large models of AI overseas or domestic so we think those kind of products will be launched next year and large-scale mass production will be carried out as well thank you thank you very much mr pen for your detailed answer and i um looking forward to the company's continued breakthroughs in performance in the second hair and the future thank you thank you for your question and next one we'd like to invite um mise sard she from goshong overseas thank you i have his three questions first of all it's about the JP margin i like to follow up the JP margin the JP margin's improvement is a significant in optics so what about the acoustics and the automotive acoustics and the microphone and the volatility what are the reasons and what are the long-term checks okay there are two parts in the consumer electronics we see there's the technical or this kind of versus another thing and in the first half the sales of a microphone is improved the part that JP margin is a little lower than last year's because we are wrapping up the new products in the first half and in the first half of the year and the revenue the JP margin for the first half is a little lower and after the wrapping up of the new products and the JP margin will return to a more healthy level and we think with the collaboration pace with our customers the JP margin will be improved in the second half of the year in terms of the automotive motive it's relatively stable in the short term the automotive market is a little fluctuated but after the acquisition of our PSS we are hoping to expand the business on a domestic market so in terms of the speakers JP margin this is a relatively balanced and the new products will be afraid that introduced and the automotive new products will be introduced in the second half this will help our JP margin in the second half and the next year and the PSS has a very solid collaboration with its customers especially in the new products on R&D and penetration so we don't need to have much to worry about this okay thank you very much and second question is about our business and we see this hybrid lens at the moment it's very very high and strong and this isn't also our competitive edge so I like to know the percentage of this on hybrids lens and in the overall lens and it's a penetration in the next three years and what's the percentage and penetration and in this question has already been mentioned by Mr. Duan before and this year and the main customer's size can reach about 10 million and in the future and we think we can achieve 15 million and this is remarkable a remarkable change and we are also the exclusive supplier to our customers and with the G plus P a solution this can help our customers to set the pain points and with the development of the system and our customers and this will trigger profound changes of our customers and in the next year we think the 15 percent growth is certain and even higher and the penetration speed is not a very fast and the most of the applications are in the afflection models and most of the supplier most of the suppliers are from us it's also 1.28 versus 1 and here the upgrade of lens will bring about changes in user experience and it will be on the mainstream so we think G plus P for this year the statement volume is about 10 million to 15 million and next year it's about 20 million whether it will be higher we still have to look at the whole product in the market at present the main cameras and the main camera with the G plus P the momentum has become more and more certain and we also see the combination of a preschool and also a preschool application but those kind of applications is lower than the G plus P solutions but many models are applying the approvals and also two in one and three in one are prisoners and this kind of momentum will be more apparent in the first half of next year okay thank you very much mr pam and last question is about dissipation and the kelvin talk about the big customers dissipation products mass production so what about the outlook in the second half and the next year or any a downgrade or slow down of this penetration or whether we will see the BC products and dissipation products on pad and the max and what are the changes are materials thank you all customers we see the AI opportunities on smartphone and the pads and the pc and the applications momentum and actually it's in line with our dissipation products our development so from the AI's function and it's a development of speed as well as the application speed it's a similar to the development pace of our BCs then this is a very deterministic chance and from the mass production it will start from high-end models and in the on overall application scenarios on the this will be a rapidly expanded penetrating from the high end to other models and the overall at demand is higher and the first so more demanding so it was an entire manufacturing process as well as the investment is quite large and demanding so we think in the future the performance of our BCs will continue to be more complex and this will be rated in the future and i think the market is potential and actually the AI's development momentum mentioned i think this year just at the beginning we just received the market still from last two years about three hundred years to this year's three times this is just a preliminary potential and the future and we will see the very large potential for the evolution thank you very much and i'd like to show you the highlights on of our financial performance and each business segments and as you see the group is actually capitalizing this upgrade and in this smart phone and also the AI glasses and our group continue to make contributions as mentioned by our management and the government is actively capitalizing a opportunity to fully empower a patient solution upgrade as shown in a lot of the figure the groups of BC shipments are expected to achieve a acre of about 90 percent between 2020 and the 2025 when the shipment volume continued double-digit growth the group both ample production resources and the future and its products cover a wide range of BC materials including copper, stainless steel, steel copper, composites and aluminum copper as well as FCCL and titanium, new materials with groups WLQ really products have rapidly expanded and received a positive market feedback the group supported the domestic customers high and flexive model with a 1g6 key main camera upgrade leading a significant breakthroughs for the WLQ in high-end optics the group also successfully mass produced and supplied the exclusive WLQ-based super-lined a prism solution and looking at how to the second half of the year more flexive models with large plastic fabric lines and micro-creams produced by the groups exclusive WLQ process will be shipped marking a milestone for the groups WLQ products line in addition groups has excellent product developments and design capabilities and is an industry leader in optical structural and mode design in a field of photos with the intelligence leading sensory interaction and other graphical ratio demands and this market size in 2030 is expected to exceed 400 million huge space this group has a perfect in real-world well eco-system and high-end multi-brand matrix building up boost that in vehicle business capabilities and the group brand system a landed luxury model designed way of the flagship SUV of a domestic and UV brand and system features is set into speakers, 14 channels, amplifiers, and the turning of services to deliver the outer luxury automotive acoustics experience at the same time we have completed the appreciation of first light and automotive microphone manufacturer the group targets a billion level market size focusing on products and deployment around high value segments of humanoid robots with advertising and development have a vertical integration probability high value component system level large modules and a sub-level algorithm the tax theory or a hand solution for robots is about to enter mass production and the group has deep technology foundation and the co-product capability in quality models, acoustics and sensors optical sensing and heat of a piece of modules and the work utility to make efforts and the focus on those fields in the future the group is comprehensively building core probability in HR and AR devices with the key projects gradually being implemented and getting used to achieve breakthroughs in acoustics and display system. The co-cutinutive supply speakers and microphones to several leading domestic and international AR-A-I classes manufacturers in the first half of the year and there are several projects in the development and the delivery the group has a global plan R&D centers and a production basis is in Asia Europe and the US nearly 20 countries and regions including Singapore, United States, Denmark, Japan, Finland and other places and in factoring basics in Russia, Malaysia, Mexico, etc they are strong support for the companies missing diversification to build an operational closed loop of capabilities. AOC will scale new heights for shareholders and the customers to bring higher returns so the above is the introduction of the performance in the first half of 2025 now we continue the QA session next the question is from the China merchants one team please for a hand good afternoon management and one team from China merchants I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to ask this question I have two questions the first question is about the robotic plan business plan and including the current business development ideas and the customers development let me talk about this and we have a lot of fun with the robotics emerge and this will provide the opportunities for us as mentioned before and we have collaborated with domestic and overseas customers on robotic motors or some in the memory development stage and most of the products are in the upgrading and the iteration of base and there will be more opportunities and for us our focus for recent years is still in cooperation with the larger customers and for the product development and secondly within AI development there will be more empowerment from AI whereas applications for example the humanoids rule box and there are large language models and actions the next one two or three years we will see more some new AI devices and some startups are focusing on those kinds of products and then apart from the two states and our six products we understand nowadays and there will be more interaction products in a short run and this is this will bend the top to the introduction of our new product because and orders so AI and application must have these kinds of but carrier or a hardware carrier and then to interact with the people and we can have some our expert devices and AI glasses thank you thank you that's all for me and the wish AOC of better development in the future thank you next question is from me one side it's very hard thank you very much I have two questions the first question is about the JP margin of the acoustics it's related to the pressure of the new products or any other innovation of pressure in terms of the JP margin Evan has already mentioned part of it and I'd like to add a little acoustics actually is our starting point and in the first half of the of this year we see a lot of changes in our acoustic products in terms of the price there are obvious changes and from our perspective and we also see our operational efficiency improvement and with the mass production and the ramping up of the mass production in the second half of the year we are very confident to maintain the JP margin level with that of last years and last year was 13.2 percent and we don't think and this year's JP margin of acoustics will be below 30 percent so you don't need to worry about this and always the development of our brand and the promotion and we think there is still potential for its improvement in the second half in addition our sales scale and this year and our JP margin is also exchanging and we collaborate with Japan at TDC and we did we do the product design packaging and the TDC provide this so the JP margin in this regard is relatively lower so this is also reviewed the profitability of the our maximum microphone and the last year and this JP margin was very stable and compared with the year before last year it was stable as well and with the TDCs collaboration the JP margin will be a little as looked down but the growth potential is still promising in the future we think and last year the growth is about 800 million to 600 million and this year the growth rate will be about 15 to 60 percent so you we still see the potential for the maximum microphone thank you very much my second question is about optics the optics revenue together with JP margin and for the first half of the year the margin for the lens and the models was the outlook and the gut line for the second half and the JP margin for the lenses I mentioned last year was over 30 percent and this year and for the first half of this year it has exceeded a 30 percent for the full year and we think the JP margin of plastic lenses will exceed the 30 percent with the JP margin scrolls there are about two outroaches and the first one is the upgrade in the plastic lenses in the market and causing the uprising hike and a stable increase and in addition we also improve our operational efficiency so we are confident and the full years JP margin growth rate can reach above 30 percent and they still have the potential for the growth okay thank you thank you mr. Pan what about oh yes this is for the JP margin growth many driven by the ASP and the ASP grows there's due to the OIS and we are in the 108 megapixel and also due to 100 megapixel and have begun to be shipped and in the second half our pre-school as well as the pre-schools of products will enter mass production and we are confident and to have the growth on the modules next year thank you this is all for me thank you management thank you one next question is from Andy Moore from Morgan Stanley please go ahead maybe the signal is a little delayed let's invite next one first Miss one hunting from the ICC thank you thank you Joyce thank you management I have two questions in the introduction the management have already provided the details for the business segments so I'd like to know the guidelines for the second half for each business segment including the revenue and the JP margin this is the first question okay thank you thank you for your question I'd like to take the question let's mention at the beginning and we have the full year and get nice and we will pick the online and the two questions before related to two dds acoustics JP margin as we introduced there are a lot of the new products directly up in the first half and the second half and the JP margin of the acoustics will be stabilized and will make things above 30 percent in terms of the M and the PM and our motor business and the growth was a rapid and in terms of the participation mentioned about a kelp burn and this is one of the highlights in the first half and this the JP margin is higher than the average JP margin of our group and this our shipment will be concentrated in the second half of the year so we think and this will be increased by about an 18 to 20 percent in terms of the cells and in terms of the JP margin we think it's about 18 to 22 percent in terms of motor the EM business segments the cells in the revenue will be increased by about 15 to 20 percent that is JP margin is also about 30 percent you talk about the optics and the JP margin of lens is very encouraging which has achieved 30 percent and the pure lens will also continue to increase in the second half of the year in terms of the overall cells are the year and year increase it's about 20 percent and including the lens and modules and the lens and the module and we also see this double-digit so at the overall year round should be between 10 to 15 and the Mr. Han also talk about the as mentioned by Mr. Penn we have our prior library products and the other products and this kind of percentage will be further increased and this will increase our top line at the same time increase improvement of the JP margin thing and this will create positive inflows on the JP margin and we think the MEMS revenue this year is about 15 percent to 60 percent and it's a JP margin increased it's about 15 to 20 percent so this is about the second man who's got a line in addition some people can start about the auto motive business and the acquisition of a PSS has already been completed and from its revenue and the JP margin and the so the contribution where it's stable and the revenue and the contribution is relatively comparable so we'll keep the growth rate in the second half and the JP margin this year for the I hope this will give you a clearer guidance yes very clear thank you very much I'm in school and we look forward to the steadily arose in revenue and the JP margin in the future my second question is about glasses and AI glasses AI and AR so what's the development and what's the collaboration with our customers and our strategy okay and we have deeply discussed without our top tier customers on AI glasses on both acoustics and optics systems and in terms of the optical weaver guys we have had in-depth discussions with some mainstream customers and hoping to realize master production in the second half of the year or breakthroughs in the next year in the future as a component and after a smart phone and in this world have a very rapid growth like watch like the electronic watch okay very clear thank you very much thank you mr shil thank you for your question next question is from Tina Wong from city Tina you hear us yes please go ahead thank you management I have two questions first a question is about motors and its future opportunities whether there are dual motors application and on the high-end models in smartphones because we see some foldable smartphones next year so we upgrade our motors and also the acoustics and system upgrades and are demanded like you know the opportunities in addition is about the camera button and some people say some camera button will be canceled in the future so whether this will influence your future product plan in addition I also like to know more about optics for example the vertical integration was the plan for the vertical integration and including the lenses and the modules and the relative reserves so what's the future plan and after motors and solution high-end optical modules I'd like to answer the question of motors and some people say next year there will be some high-end foldable smartphone it's possible to be equipped with several motors or multiple motors and this may be a momentum in the future in the high-end smartphone models so from this scenario we think there will continue on upgrading their product if we see the opportunities of course we will go through and support this development so we have our plans in the outer thing and motor which is in line which is the momentum and last year we shipped the camera button modules we didn't hear any or we've seen any news that just kind of a function so buttons will be canceled and some information in the case there will be more potential opportunities in the iteration and this will give us more opportunities to help our customers and a lot of customers overseas and receive any information that this will be canceled thank you very much thank you Tino's question next we'd like to invite a cherry map from a curry please go ahead thank you I see it is a PSS at the Acoustics business and it grows it's a very good or it's a cost structure and they need more a new product to be introduced and to improve it's a GP margin let me answer the question and after very and you have a little background noise on your side to please mute for a while thank you very and we have some awkward business in this product and this cost influence and change in the GP margin no matter what kind of changes it has this year and we believe the revenue and the profitability will cut the flood with that of last year in PSS and we also see these collaboration PSS collaboration with their European customers to obtain the design wings this year so this will guarantee the revenue and the GP margins is stable growth so that's the development and the market potential of a PSS in the alternative or relative acoustics automotive acoustics okay another one is about acoustics and the GP margin for the first half is then slowed down because we are in the cost or other reasons as explained before the acoustics GP margins is slowed down in the first half it's related to the new products mass production there are more new products mass production and that's the reason we have the confidence to maintain the full year GP margin of a 13 percent and this is not related to R&D cost so it is new of the new products was not high and this influenced the GP margin a new production introduction the new products introduction will affect the GP margin at some stage okay thank you very much very clear okay last question is from Tony Zhang please go ahead thank you very much for the opportunity the plastic lenses the GP margin has already reached 30 percent and the width hours go up and what the GP margin of the plastic lens and what the GP margin of our hybrid G plus P lenses I was still ramping up this year and then next year and what the specific GP margin in this regard in addition the optic business and what's the net profit level what's the overall net profit level and what's the outlook for its net profit level in the second half of the year enemy school perhaps you can take the question of the net profit in the second half of the year the the plastic lens of GP margin will be higher and this is related to our technology operate rate and improvement so 40 percent will be our target of plastic lens in terms of electric plus P the main product together with our WLT GP margin we can see above 35 percent level and this is the level we can see in the long run we think G plus P will be similar or even higher than the plastic lens GP margin and of course it depends on the WLTs skill and the magic application so we think G plus P can be similar to our key RGP margin okay I like to talk about the net profit the net profit optics for the first half and has already become positive and it discontinues the trend of RQ4 last year and with the modules shipment volume increase and also with DLP lens and a WLT this year the volume is about a 10 million there's a very impressive duty over roll net profit will be improved on this basis okay thank you very much I'd like to ask the follow-up question so do you plastic lens and DDWNG hybrid lens apart from its application smartphone business any new applications in dear Jones or like action cameras or autonomous cars etc yes we are collaborating with the top tier enterprises and the manufacturers and in the action cameras and the Jones and then to provide them with a good lens and this is our none mobile phone business the the trend for us is to provide integrated solutions to our customers thank you very much thank you Tony and last on the links like to ask our question from the message board this is from Andy Mo he mentioned the company's business is growing very fast and looking forward to the second half of the year with the introduction of the projects from major customers can we achieve significant increase in revenue scale and with the development of the dissipation projects can we continue to promote the growth of the dissipation business in terms of the dissipation business and this year the growth is certain and last year if I remember correctly it's about 320 million and this year we think we can reach about a 1.2 billion even higher year and the growth in the future will be double digits our investments in R&D peak and the Capac in the same and autonomous and application in this dissipation business and also the equipment investment from the passive heat dissipation to the adaptive dissipation and this is very much complying with the development of AI and this will become a new driving force of our

of revenue is very stable and in the second half of the year and in this kind of growth will not be slowed down and this is about the 3D to the growth and this 3D to the growth can be sustained in the next few years and with this double double digit growth we don't mean to give up the pursuit of a GP margin growth and we will achieve this high growth and the basis of a stable or even higher GP margin so this is the confidence from our management and with the transformation led by Kevin for the past five years we have already seen these achievements and efficiency improvement from this transformation and secondly our R&D and the sales and the management expenses and it's actually an ender control with this kind of expenses and control and we also pursue the return of net profit margin and of course the strong cash position will provide us a more stable development we are constantly looking for and managing such opportunities last one at least and the first of all the optical lenses and we want to achieve 30% or even 40% in the patient business will scale up from the 300 million last year and to this year's 1.2 billion or even larger scale and this has become our import in
