Good afternoon, everyone. Now, we'd like to start the earnings call by screen holdings for the second quarter, fiscal year 2026. And let me introduce you to these speakers. So, we have to go to the President of Director, Member of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer. This is go to and your Ichi Kondo, Director, Member of the Board, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. And in addition to CEO and CF4, we have three executive members. Manabu Isimura, Managing Executive Officer. This is Isimura. And Akihiko Miyagawa, Senior Executive Officer. This is Miyagawa. And Chihou Otobel, Executive Officer. This is Otobel. Thank you very much for this opportunity. Now, we will invite Vice President Kondo to give us the presentation on the consolidated business results and the forecast. Mr. Kondo, microphone is yours. Thank you very much. Let me give you the consolidated business results and the forecast. First, this is our final week. Considered earnings for the first half, net sales, $274.2 billion, operating income, $46.4 billion, and OPE emergency, $16.9%. And here on the year, the sales and profits both decreased. And SBE, sales and profits both fell here on the year. And some of the projects, revenue recognition, was shifted to the second half. And this is the, this is a con decrease from the outlook in July. So as for the fully focused, we haven't changed it yet. And as for FT, sales and profits rolled significantly on the year. And because of the strong displayed market, so the sales of all that equipment increased. And on the balance, the equity ratio is 64.4% has been even stable. And this is the details of the consulate earnings, so the net sales, $274.2 billion, operating income, $46.4 billion, OPE emergency, that's 16.9%. I was on the income, $46.8 billion, net income, $31.8 billion, and this is the composition of group sales by destination, Japan, 16%, Taiwan, 25%, and China, 40%, Korea, 5%, Asia, other, 3%, North America, 8%, Europe, 4%. And composition of group sales by segment, other, 0.4%, PE, 1.8%, FT, 9.8%, GA, 9.3%, SBE, 78.8%. And this is a concerted earnings by segment SBE in the first half, 218.5 billion yen, and operating income was 48% for 6 billion yen, will be emerging 22.3%. That is the sales and profit both fell, because sales, part of the sales, 52 second half. And sales for DRAM and the fast memory grows, initial sales to China declined, next GA sales, 25.8 billion yen, OPE income, 1.2 billion yen, OPE immersion, 4.7%, sales group, while profits fell. That is because of the impact of the US-TALIF and Fx. FT net sales, 23.5 billion yen, OPE income, 3.9 billion yen, OPE immersion, 16.9% in sales and profits both grew. All the sales increased, and we could achieve the significant improvement in the OPE version, and PE, 1.5 billion yen, and sales minus 0.2 billion yen, OPE income, so they're lost. And sales and profits both fell, expecting capital investment to recover in the second half and onward. And this is the financial standing, and this is a balance sheet on a concerted basis. And total asset is 67.2, so it increased, and equity ratio now stands at 64.4%, so it's been quite stable. And this is the cash flow on a concerted basis, and the second quarter operating cash flow amounted to 23.8 billion yen, and we spent a 2.5 billion yen for the investment. So we have the final cash flow of the 21.2 billion yen, and the second first half that operating cash flow, the 30.8 billion yen, an investment cash flow was a minus 1.2 billion yen, and a minus 1.8 billion yen, and a minus 1.2 billion yen, and a minus 2.9 billion yen, and a minus 29.9 billion, I believe, that is the event of how it's used for the digital payment and investment. Next is Alan Expenses, CapEx and Legalization, Amortization. So Alan D is a 30.8 billion yen, CapEx 28 billion yen, Immigration and Amortization, 15 billion yen, so there's no change from the April figures. Many with the SPE, the Alan Expenses and Personal Expenses are in line with expectation. And CapEx will be R&D, Manufacturing, IT, all funded at Extended Range. And this is the analysis of operating income growth. So again, so the last years are first half in middle comparison against the 58.2 billion yen, because of the sales capacity visualization, and there's some shift to the second half, and also the profitability. There was a big impact from the shift to the second half, and there was a minus 9.5 billion impact on fixed cost, so it stands out of 46.4 billion yen. And there's a contribution by FDMGA, but there is a shift in the SPE and profitability declined in JGA. And fixed cost increased due to the growth investment, mainly attributable SPE, including Alan Expenses, Personal Expenses, Deployation, Amortization, and exchange weight, mainly impacted negatively on GA. And this is the business forecast. So on the right side, you can find the forecast. So it sells 621 billion yen of income, 150, 70 billion yen of immersion, 18.8 billion, and only income 170 billion yen, and then income 88% gain will change from the original forecast. SPE 102 billion yen, and will be merged, 121 billion yen of 2.4% of the of immersion, GA 50 billion yen, 2.5 billion of the income, 4.7% of immersion, no change in FT. Now the forecast forecast for net sales will change to the 40 billion yen, and it's because of the actual performance the change was made. And PENO change, net sales, 50 million yen, and OB income plus 1 billion yen. FT increase is adjusted. So there's no change in the total figure. This is the current situation we now have. And this analysis of where the income both scored justice. So this is the actual against the forecast. So last year, the one had 45% worth 6 billion yen, and there was a plus 2 million from the sales and capacity authorization, but there was an income impact from the effects and inventory. So profitability is improvement of the 2 billion yen, and the fixed cost is 19.5 billion yen, same figure from the previous report, and there's a minus 3 billion yen impact from the exchange rate. So when we see the actual illustration in the first half, we have slightly changed figures for the exchange rate. And so the expectation is under 17 billion yen. On the right side, expect to drink a contribution by FTGA and BE for the self-in capacity. And as of profitability, we have the FTNSP contribution. And the fixed cost increase expected due to the and exchange rates, as you can find, are these other expected exchange rates. So we maintain the forecast and income dividend will be as per our 120 C, and the yen dividend will be 157. So total will be 280. So we don't change this expectation. So that's all from myself. Thank you very much, Mr. Kondo. Now we want to move on to the business environment and outlook from President Mr. Goto. So now I'm going to talk about business environment and outlook. So we've got here 2026 March. This is the fully outlook, SPE, the leading edge node foundries and memory-related cells centered on HPL. We remain solid, taking advantage on AI-related capital investments. So this is the basic situation of SPE. And FTE segment, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing good performance in sales and profits expected, supported by active display investment for OLED and LCD. And advanced packaging sales and projects for panel-level equipment, including panel quarters and dive imaging systems, and we have a level of equipment for cleaning, progressing as planned. And we are making the steady implementation of growth investment, centering along the advanced packaging. So for this, in next midterm, we are going to make a further close about this. This is SPE business overview. The market trend and outlook, WFV, the calendar year 2025, we are expecting low, single-digit growth. So around 110 billion or above. In calendar year 26, continued growth is anticipated, primarily driven by AI-related demand for reading edge node foundries and memory. So maybe second half next year, we are going to see some movement and investment by application. Foundry AI-related demand is again significant driving investment, not only in Taiwan but other regions. AI-related demand for cutting edge device is progressing. And logic. So capital investments for logic, the client remain a cautious approach towards capital investment and memory. So spot points is now going up and D-LAM is expected to sustain solid investment and also NAND is also very strong. And that's to D-LAM. There are new areas such as OpenAI, which is driving demand. So we will see continuous progress. On this investment. And NAND investment will mainly focus on increasing multi-dailing and image devices. The capital image devices, looking at market condition, we are going to make the decision cautiously. For now, we need to still examine our further investment and power device and others. Industrial or automotive demand remains weak, particularly in China. And recovery is expected from calendar year 26 and onward at the advanced packaging. The further capital investment are anticipated, driven by a greater sophistication in back-end processes. So China, market, the investments by existing foundries remain solid. While emerging chip manufacturers, they are gradually entering into the evaluation phase. So looking at this evaluation, a progress, we will consider how we will make investment. So for China market, probably the existing foundry is the main area where we see the investment. The SPE, this is the sales pie application and for sales. As you can find in Q and Q, sales to D-LAM and in second quarter, it's 48%, and logic is 4%, and the fresh is same, 4%, and D-LAM is 80%. And others, power device is 1%. Other is 4%. For sales is 21%. That's the trend or breakdown of the second quarter. And SPE, this is sales by destination. So Japan is 14%, and Taiwan is 30%. It's slightly coming down from one Q, first quarter, and China is 38%, and Korea is 5%. And as your other, and also the other, it's 3%. North America is 7%, and Europe is 4%, so Q and Q, sales to China and Japan rose, and Yale near, sales to Taiwan and Japan increased. That's the situation of now. So this is SPE competition of sales by application, focused. So both sales and you can find this Yale near, focused out of 502, foundry account for 45%, logic 7, and flash 4, D-LAM 16%, and imaging device 2%, power device 2%, and other 5%, and post sales 18%, that's the breakdown of the forecast. So for the first half, the D-LAM fresh increase likely, and against the forecast of second half, versus first half, D-LAM logic and other expected to increase. In Yale near, Yale expected to increase. So here's SPE competition of sales by destination, and here's the forecast. The sources are 502, and Japan account for 11%, and Taiwan, 24%, China, 43%, and Korea, 6%, and Asia, other, Oseania, 6%, North America, 7%, and Europe, 3%. So compared to last year, the Taiwan increased significantly. That's the trend of Yale near, and against first half, sales to China expected to increase in second half. And against full year or last year, sales to Taiwan expected to increase. So here's the G.A. segment, sales trend, and forecast. So the recalling business remains stable. So this has about half, and while affected by U.S. public policies, efforts underway to enhance profitability, serial patient efficiency, and price pass through. This is FT sales trend and forecast. So compared to last year, we saw significant improvement. The sales is 46 billion, and about half is coming from all that new investment. And 25 is LCD. This is conventional, and the remaining is both sales and other. So this situation is going to continue, or actually continuing in the second half, and it's going to continue next year. This is the PE sales trends and forecast. So for PE segment, market itself still takes time to recover, and sales is a 15 billion yen expected, and of which 45% is both the sales and equipment and others accounts for another 55%. So the market sees a sign of recovery, but we have to wait until next year and beyond to see the actual contribution. So we'll continue to see the recovery of sales with cost of sales. And this is an initiative related to ESG. So about the social contribution, we had the vision of the partner-spiriting degradation. So following the policy of the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, the regulation previously issued by holdings on behalf of the entire group has been devised to separate the regulations for holdings and each business entity. So for SDE, GA, FT, and PE, for each segment, we'll have the degradation of the partnership. Next is about governance. So we conducted a large-scale BCP drill. So the large-scale natural disaster may occur. So in the next phase, I'm such a successful drill was conducted. And this time, with a simulation of the mega quake of the Namka itself, we had a drill simulating initial emergency actions needed after the disaster and a total 260 participants exercised an industrial, including the emergency infrastructure, include the communication methods, was confirmed, and after a certain period after the disaster, how to continue the business was exercised with 260 participants. And we'll continue to have this kind of drill so that we can be well-prepared against disasters. And these are the screen group news. And you may have heard these news, through the news releases. As you can see here, we have the releases of these news. And I'd like to highlight one of them. But it's about topics. So this is the one about which we released the news release. That is about acquisition of an all-landy business in way for bonding from Nikon. And it was agreed upon, a contractor signed on September 30th. And this is an strategic investment we make. So we positioned advanced packaging as a focus field. So in addition to the cells of the direct imaging systems and colder dryer systems, we are working on development and rollout of the high-lit bonding and low-temperature wafer pumping. This is the purpose of this acquisition. And with this acquisition, we can combine Nikon's know-how about the precision bonding with our technology so that we can establish our presence in this field of the advanced packaging, which is a focus in the mid-term management plan. And about the overview of the acquisition, you can find information in the material. And so the advanced packaging seeking more than more. As you can find here, the bonding is very important. We're getting more and more important. And the impact of the heat has to be minimized when we have the bonding. So we have the kappa kappa, a low-temperature high-lit bonding being developed. So our technology and Nikon's bonding technology will be combined so that we can make a new presence in this market. And we have been collaborating. We have been working on the high-lit bonding machine and we will make the father development of this so that we can have the great presence in this market. Next topic. So we have the variety of collaboration with IBM. And this time, we have the agreement for next-generation EUT photography cleaning process development. This is the additional agreement. So two-millimeter beyond the miniature process requires the high NA and related miniature cleaning technology is required. So in collaboration with IBM, we establish this process. So for the next generation device, cleaning process is essential. And we will work together with IBM to establish what to develop the necessary cleaning process. And this is the contract we concluded. And next topic. Screen holdings was awarded 2025 Portage Prize. And Stutzpasi Business School hosted this older prize. And we applied it for it. And our product process and innovation related to management were acknowledged. And we were awarded Portage Prize this time. And before having this articulation, various initiatives we took and uniqueness and strategic points of these were highly appreciated that the reason why we could have of this prize. And on December 2nd, the prize awarding ceremony will be held. So this is announcement we made. And we have other topics, but as for the others, please refer to the material. That's all from me. Thank you very much. Now we'd like to go into the Q&A session. So I'd like to invite me to address the announcement from IR. So a new report 2025 was issued at the end of September. So it's not about the sort of view, but the mid to long term strategy is now compiled in this annual report under the new management structure launched in June 2025. And you can find the actual words by the management team. Next page, please. And every time after the earnings call, we have the small group meetings to be hosted by screen. And Japanese one is on November 21st and English one is on November 19th. So please, you trust these occasions. And lastly, about the IR days on December 16th, Tuesday, starting at 3.30. Onside the installation starts from 3.00. And at our Monze Nakachot site in Tokyo, we are going to have this IR day. And we also provide the high-bleed type of meetings. So when you make yourself available, please come to our Tokyo office. But you can also attend this meeting online. And we're going to talk about our growth strategy. And we will have the Monzekototo president as a speaker. And we can talk about the SPE technologies too. So please utilize this opportunity. So I'm going to have your kind attendance to this event. That's all from me. Let me talk today. Thank you very much. Now we'd like to go into the Q&A sessions from Olugan Stanley. Let me start with Akim. So this is what Akim from Olugan Stanley and UFG. I have one question to you. Okay. So WA 3.4 kills from 26. You are saying the low single visit. But at this moment, what's the situation? Maybe compared to three months ago, is it improving? Yeah, I'm Goto. I'm going to respond. For our outlook, there's no major change from previous expectation. So next year, a gloss next year will be low single visit. This is our assumption. So the maybe memory and dilemma still, the capacity is not sufficient. And boundary utilization is now getting higher. So we think it's getting better. But still, even with these kind of not changes, you don't change your forecast, right? The next year, a gloss, even if it happens, maybe second half of the next year, we will see the effect. So if we look at, consider next year, the gloss will be maybe like low to mid single visit. After like next year, there's a possibility to go up. But for next fiscal year, we don't think there will be major change from previous forecast. Thank you very much. My second question is, so first half, there is fish out of the cells. So you couldn't achieve the forecast. So this is by destination. So China is the reason. That's what I can understand. But this China, second half, is it going to be postponed to next fiscal year? I feel some with no concern. Is there any possibility that this is postponed to next fiscal year? Well, as to possibility, of course, it's not zero. However, like second half, we are trying to achieve the sales on this second half. So for year-on-year, we don't change the forecast. And we are now making progress. And in local, or we are confident that we can make the sales by the end of this fiscal year, maybe last year, you said probability of second quarter is still high. And now it's happening like this. So maybe the situation is different for each customer. But do you have any concrete situation? Like installation is already ready, or you have the commitment from top executive of the customer. We are under negotiation right now, and we don't think it's bad. That's the situation. So we cannot say we are sure at this moment. So, but we are feeling a great sense of the confidence while conducting with our customer. Thank you very much. I understand. Next from Golden Mass Access, Mr. Nakamura, please. Thank you for this opportunity. My first question is about the profitability of SPCE. So, the sales first pushed out to the second half, but I want to know about this low profitability of operating profit in the second quarter. So SPCE sales hasn't changed from the first quarter, but the profitability decreased. What is the background of this? And in the second half, 25% more is planned. And we should elaborate on this. So the first half will be immersion seems a bit low, because the product mix and customer mix impacted it. And in the second half, as you mentioned, 25% is a target, and that is better than the second half. And the activity to improve the profitability is not taking place. So even with change in the product mix, we may not be willing to cure the profit better than in the past. Thank you very much. My second question about the sales of the sales outrok for this fiscal year of SPE. So total expectation hasn't changed. But by the destination, I think you a little bit changed the competition. So as you explain, these changes you made, especially the sales to China, originally it was 40%, but it was declined. So I think there was some project pushed out to the second half. So as you elaborate from where you have the inquiries, and for the next fiscal year, what percentage of the sales do you expect from China? Do you see any art? Do you have any art? So China sales, the major course is the project pushed out to the second half. That's why we see the big sales in second half. And other sales, at this moment, we have the good specifically about the second half sales composition. So based on that, we will review the sales and the production plan. And that's how we come up with these figures. And about next fiscal year, China sales proportion will be slightly as a climb to the little bit over 30%. So as we have been saying, the emerging customers in China will go back to the normal situation. And then our sales to China will go back to the 30% level. So please understanding that way. So the sales to China, our trick, let's be a bit slightly increased. What do you think of this? So as was mentioned earlier, now we are really good, they call it inquiry we now receive. And the some sales shifted to the second half. And based on that, we came up with these figures. So the inquiry is by the measure of foundry, and then customers with which we have the longer relationship. And we now expect the sales from that customer in the second half of this fiscal year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Nakamura. Next is Shimamoto-san from Okassan. Thank you very much. I am Shimamoto from Okassan Securities. WFP2026. I want to understand the focus better. In previous discussion, the focus for next year is the maybe need simple visit, maybe around 5%. Is it correct? And in addition, the application foundry or memory, maybe you can separate dilemma and logic. Can you just give us the breakdown per each application? So as to numbers, it's the meet single visit. This is our expectation. So the trend by application, as they say, the cutting edge to nano or steel nano capex will continue next to like second half next year. This is what we are expecting. So foundry portion is going to lead. And also memory in the D-LAM HPE-M will be the main investment target. This is what we are expecting for next year. So memory, D-LAM is going to lead the demand. Thank you very much. So foundry and D-LAM, which is going to go fast. Can you comment on that? It's not easy. Probably they will glow at the same rate. That's our expectation. Thank you very much. So my second question is NICOM business. The impact for your result, if you are expecting any 40CL on next year, fiscal year. Yeah. This business transfer impact. So this is within our strategic investment budget. So there is no major impact for this fiscal year or next fiscal year. Thank you very much. This is also speaking. I want to just add on to that. What Goto said is true. And this fiscal year, 3 billion yen transfer price. That's what we are expecting. It's going to take maybe a couple of years until launch. So maybe 5 to 6 billion yen. Thank you. So it's already included in the. So it's not going to be addition. That's correct. That's correct. Thank you. Understood. Thank you very much. That's my model. Now, let me invite Mr. Ishida from she has the same securities. This is Ishida. The second half SPE sales. So the third and the fourth quarter, when we divide the self expectation, how do you see them? And the next year, you have an image that it will continue to recover into the second half. And from this fiscal year to second half to the first half of you see the situation. So let me have the image of the timeline. So as for the sales for this fiscal year, fourth quarters one will be later than the third quarter. So the sales, when you compare the third and the fourth quarter, the one in the fourth quarter will be greater. And as for the next fiscal year, as you mentioned, in the first half of next fiscal year, we expect to, as we did it for today, and this year, going through the situation, but the exact investment to plan will be carried out in the second half. So we expect to recover the first recovery in the second half of next year. In that sense, the competitors account the sales when they shape the product, but you account the sales in the installation. So it's a kind of difference of one quarter. So when we complete the installation, we account the sales. So from the timing of the shipment to the installation, there's a kind of time log. So compared to the other companies who account the sales at the time of the shipment, the timing of the accounting sales will be a bit different. Thank you very much. My second question is about the IR day, and in which I use the problem to talk about what it will be in 10 years from now. And what other things are going to talk about on the occasion of IR day in December? So if we disclose everything, I cannot give you the good motivation to come. And so please come to this event. If you cannot make us available physically, you can use online system. So you can hear from us about what we want to achieve in 10 years from now. So what would be the focus areas for us? And what would be the focus? The technologies we should have. And we'd like to talk about these as much possible on this occasion. So please kindly make yourself available to come to this event. And ask questions on that occasion. So at this moment, I'm sorry, we cannot talk about the details of the topics on IR day. Thank you very much. So I'm going to attend this meeting. Thank you. Thank you. So here I got some from you, which you please. I'm here. I come up from you. My first question is about memory. The market is now recovering. And maybe second half of next year, you can have some expectation. Good expectation. But cutting edge logic. So now we are seeing only one strong giant, but surrounding company are also seeing some movement. So when you're making negotiation, compared to three months ago, is there any difference or more type of investment you see better compared to three months ago? The foundry leading the cutting edge you are familiar, I believe. But other than this company, there are some foundries which you're doing the Tesla project or the American Large Logic Maker. They have been struggling. However, now they are trying to start to recover. So market overall is getting stronger. So not only Taiwan, but as it states here, they know somebody is also become another strong point, strong hold of the logic manufacturing. So from next second half next year, we are expecting good recovery. So as follow up, are you receiving any inquiry already? We cannot talk concretely at this moment. However, as a trend, we are seeing that kind of trend already. Thank you very much. My second question is maybe due to my ignorance, within your presentation, you are now changing the price of SPE. What do you mean by this? So we are increasing the cost. So we are now trying to pass on to the price, to customer. This is the effort that we have been making. And now this is getting fluid. So now we are seeing the improvement of SPE profit margin towards second half. So this pass on passing on to the price. If cost increases 100, so how much can you recover? So until second half this year, how far can you recover out of 100 of the cost increase that you have already experienced? So as you know, the raw material cost increased by 25% for the last three years. This is the consensus of the society or the industry. And over this 25, we hope we can pass on to our equipment plans, but we cannot do that. So please, we want to recover. And in order to do that, we are making a lot of projects. So now we are approaching to our target. This is what I want to share. Thank you very much. Yeah, calls on. Thank you very much. Thanks for Jeff Lee's security. Mr. Nakano, please. This is Nakano Mio from Jeff Lee's. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. And other than the speaker, please mute yourself. And I have one question. Let me confirm this point. So next year, WFE will achieve the mid-single digit growth. That's what you explained. And when you see China alone, what is the outlook? So China market itself will grow by the same level for this fiscal year or slightly better. That's how we expect. So for FY 25, how do you see the China market? So FY 25, China market. So it's been flat. So compared to the previous year, it's been flat. So when I see the sales, you reveal the figures. And so maybe there's a difference between dollar and yen terms. But there's a drop by about 5%. And the sales of next year, sales in China will be flat, like the development of the market itself. So as I mentioned earlier, next year's sales, China's proportion will be about to hire infanties for close to 40% percent. So compared to this fiscal year, proportion will be a little bit smaller, but the absolute value will not change so much. The reason why I asked this is because in a case, as you explained, you have the slower investment by the emerging customers. So do you expect these emerging customers will begin to move in next fiscal year, so that you can expect the stronger sales in China in next fiscal year? So as for the emerging customers, we do not plan ourselves with the dependence on these emerging customers. So emerging and existing customers in China, we take the good balance. So if the emerging customers may make the bigger investment than we expect, we can have the stronger sales than expected. But next fiscal year, following this fiscal year, we expect the China market will be flat. This is a common situation. I understand. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Shabano Sam from City Group. Thank you very much. I am Shabano from City Group Security. SPE per destination. I want to make confirmation and expectation for next year. So Japan, SPE, the assumption for second half, it's like significant country reduced. And I want to know the reason. And the cameras asked the question about Chinese sales. The comparative statements ago, you're seeing some increase for logic and foundry. Is it correct that it's increasing for logic and country? And maybe Saudi billion delay from first half. Is it from first company, mostly from one company, or maybe from a couple of companies? So first of all, these Chinese sales delay, it's not easy to disclose in detail. I think you may know some customer is now delaying. The difference between first and second half is due to that. This is what you can use for calculation to understand the impact. And Japanese customer, from Japanese customer, like image element, or legacy node investment, it's now slow and it's been down. That's the situation of now. The Taiwanese customer in Kyushu, we count as Japanese destination. So in total, that kind of product mix we are now having. Understood, very clear. Thank you. So next fiscal year, WFP is mid-single visit. So China portion is drastically dropping from 40 some percent to 30 some percent. So on consolidated basis, the sales and profit increase can be expected. Or maybe if you look at like the next fiscal year, single, it's not easy. Can you share your feeling right now? Well, we have been working on to improve profitability. And of course, China, if we see more profitable customer, we can see the increase. However, we are not relying heavily on that and we have been working on the food improvement in other areas and we are not seeing the fruit. So even if the portion of China drops that much, we are confident that we can secure a profit. So the mid-term senior prong that we have committed, we are confident to clear and we are preparing for next mid-term prong already. So we don't think we see drastic degrees due to this moderate trend of China. We understand very clear. Thank you very much. Shwano-san, thank you very much. It seems there is no other person with questions that disclose that you are on the session now. And this concludes the earnings call by the screen holdings for the second quarter for the year ending in March 2026. And thank you very much for your participation despite your success.
