There was because of the new office, what we have moved in. So we thought it will be a good idea to start the new office with the AGM. Thank you, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, I am excited to share our achievements for the financial year 2024-25 and our vision moving forward. First, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our shareholders for your unwavering support. Your trust is the cornerstone for our success and we reflect on our journey and the set new goals. You had the chance of reviewing the panel report and the auditors financial statements for the financial year 24-25, which I will consider as red. It is with a sense of measured optimism and immense pride that I present to you the performance of the company for the financial year 24-25 in a year marked by global volatility and economic shift. Your company delivered good results and also strengthened its foundation for long-term sustainable growth. This was a year with challenges, volatility in green coffee, green prices, driven by supply side disruptions and keep producing countries along with the rising global freight and energy costs. Inflationary measures were mitigated through operational efficiencies, selective cost passed through arms and a commitment to maintaining competence, maintaining competitiveness without compromising client relationships. Our disciplined balance sheet strong cash flow generation and prudent risk management practices ensured stability amidst micro economic uncertainty. The financial year was defined by consistent performance even as the global landscape remained unpredictable. The close year 2024-25 with a 17% year on earth increase in revenue and a 24% rise in net profit. Your company declared a dividend of rupees 5 on the lining of our commitment to delivering value to the shareholders. One of our most important milestones this year was successful operationalization of the expanded Vietnam facility. For me personally walking through the new production lines was a powerful affirmation of what strategic planning and teamwork can achieve. The expansion has significantly enhanced our capacity particularly in freeze drying and also in spray drying formats enabling us to respond faster to the needs of our growing client base across East Asia and Latin America. Most more than just an increasing in throughput this facility positions as closer to the key markets and strengthening the presence of the supply chain. Our social responsibility efforts were equally focused with more than 3.44 crores allotted towards the healthcare, education, women's employment and rural development programs near all our focus remains clear. We will maximize capacity utilization of our expanded facilities in Vietnam and India and continue to shift our portfolio towards high value differential coffee products, automation and digitalization integration and sustainability will be our theme across all our operations in fusion. In closing I want to thank the entire CCL family our shareholders, employees, other outsourced to sources, customers, distributor, channel operators, suppliers, all our bankers, all the government different government authorities for their continued support. Regarding the shareholders your confidence in us is invaluable and we are creating a new creation of shareholder value and looking forward to your continued support. Thank you very much. Now I invite the shareholders to share their observations and ask any questions which we may answer. The already there is list of shareholders who have been registered with us only the registered shareholders only can ask questions. That's as per law. I request the company secretary to read out the names of the speakers. Thank you. Thank you sir. The first speaker shareholder is Shriyaran Puma Bopan. Please unmute yourself. Please go and speak. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. You are already there. Yes please. I want to thank everybody. Thanks to Steve Javi for arranging. CRP is a broad moment for me to open the innings for you from the 66 to 64 AGM. I built up a story on Carl Ajar Carl that is yesterday today and tomorrow for CCL. See your story is from a bean to belief 30 years ago you started CCL. A journey is a milestone worth honoring. It was one idea from you one vision one cup an idea brewed in silence a cup that traveled continents and an empire of export excellence was born from a sleepy village of Andra to 110 countries for which you deserve all the credit from buying land with little foresight doing pooja in the neighbors site to battle bureaucracy and fighting financial drugs you bought you won these battles alone and one bringing people together across oceans languages and generations today the battle has passed any corporate it should be a relay running race should go from generation to generation not from one family to one family alone. Aaj today that was yesterday as we are at infection point history teaches that ex-growth company is eventually plateau worth some mental decline without realizing it are we resting on past levels while market transform their owners. So the cars, restaurants, mountains were old sand casual wash away it's a natural tendency for for disorder to set in but CCL the livelihoods take thousands of dependency you see directly indirectly the market is no longer rocket science technology open knowledge is accessible so come to the questions there's rising debt and capital intensity over capital investments are rising that may be a historic high meanwhile global competition is multiplying instant coffee is no longer a protected niche what is a correct position how are we then how many of our customers or vendors have started manufacturing instant coffee at themselves does it affect our margins and bargain power for long term sustainability and local market because India is going to be the consumer up of the world what is CCL's contribution to the local market what is the sales achieved what is the cost incurred for local marketing and I think we need some soul today Aaj I think we need some soul searching because earlier when we had problem you did the course correction with character you rebuilt with integrity patience and courage now is the time to reevaken that spirit again because I think this time for some soul searching so there's what is called as paradise principle I hope the energy committee takes care of it 20% give 80% of the results and 80% give 80% of the problems I work for a lot of companies in Bombay and they asked me to do was to go around and say you have too many staff your human resources have become human remains I said you better work out on that was to is perfect and I hope the same principle applies to CCL also because too many unwanted staff need to trim the HR human resources resources must not become human remains as we call in the army and a lot of flab of staff please trim that and surgical correction is needed for welfare of CCL and independent directors they're not decorative they're guardians of shareholder trust and corporate governance I hope the NRC committee takes into account account into this and I would advise forensic accounting and HR audit for course correction for future for Annavalekal there's a lot more about Annavalekal keli in corporate life temptations are everywhere but opportunities are few and precious a dream I shed it leaves but never it roots I hope CCL will never shed its roots in conclusion may your beans stay aromatic and your brands stay authentic let's raise our mugs to a future full of flavor not just figures and I support CRP's reappointment as he's given to chairman for the next five years thank you very much for the pleasure see you after a long time CRP the 30th celebration I was very proud they was given due respect to you because people younger generation of forgetting the older older generations and I think we are living longer than younger generations I hope the company survives longer than us so that the families continue I know how you accompany one man show one man's teller so I wish you all the best thank you very much thank thank you very much there was see most important these I have to clarify that the debt is reduced from last year and also you will see next two years or so there will be substantial reduction see why there was a debt this time was primarily because we went for state of art plant in our cochole which is in Tirpati district now so and also what we have done see if you look at the Giraala plant when we started in 1930 years back in 1995 our philosophy was to create jobs in the villages so unfortunately see what many things happened and the government support from the free bees started coming and there are no more employment so what we have done we have backward integration transport in every possible way what we have done all our new plants also old plants also we have modernized and together our plant which was a 30 year old plant is fully automized now so that's the reason we had to take some debt because we always believe in taking debt and immediately as early as possible to clear it so if you really look at our debt more is on working capital which is fully covered only the debt is slowly getting reduced and in future also it will be reduced as far as the you know HR will think is concerned yes there are few issues we have been addressing now HR committee is also very clear what we are doing so systems have been built see initially what happens is specially when we are coming to domestic market there will be an issue and you know it's a learning curve for us because we are mostly we were in exports now we are coming to domestic market I always say domestic branding is very important so that is the reason it might be looking like no HR in issues will become yes there will be challenging see we are whom are we competing we we are competing with the world largest food company so it will be challenging but God has been kind to us to the company to the shareholders the products is excellent so we are slowly going forward you will see the results in next two three years plenty of things will be challenged thank you very much Arun for your good wishes and what willing all shareholders will benefit with

The next shareable speaker is Sreejay Abhishek Bhatt. The objectives are mutual sales. I'd like to enable the cameras, as well. You can do it, you can do it. First of all, I congratulate the management on the eve of annual general body meetings. At first all, as well, with you and your family, in this challenging situation, our company deserves much more respect than the current market cap. After completing more than a decade of successful operations, profitability, and becoming one of the strongest brands in the respective segments. So, our company is doing really well. Our stock price has escalated. Our performance is gone up. Our EPSP ratio and return and equity is gone up. It is all because you have a hard work, sir. Your hard work and sincerity has brought the company to this particular extent. And you are able to reward the minority shareholders in large numbers. So, we really appreciate the entire board of directors for the essential efforts in bringing the company to this particular extent, and rewarding the minority shareholders in good numbers. So, I hope that you take all of the questions, the right spirit. I would request the management to kindly arrange for a planned visit for the shareholders, sir. And since for the past five to six years, the shareholders are not able to meet you physically. We are forced to meet you virtually, kindly arrange hybrid agents in the years to come, whereas most of the senior citizens share out in the not able to join, because of the digital challenges in this virtual platform. So, if you can kindly consider hybrid in the years to come, more number of shareholders can join in the meeting to get the valuable points, suggestions and ideas that will be helpful for the management to empower in the coming future. And nowadays, many companies are being conducting hybrid across the country and MC and CB has permitted both the options or hybrid options, whichever the management seems better, so that it may be implemented by the management. And what are the steps being taken by the management, sir, to reduce the other expenses, legal professional charges, and the audit fees. So, then myself and my team are running a legal firm in the name and style of seven works associates in Chennai. So, I would request the management to find the end of the firm in the environment of the company. And we will be glad to extend our services. So, then I would request the management to take part in one call quarterly presentations and meeting with global investors on a regular basis. And also, as you already said, you can launch your product in Pan India basis in Argyali, Mimalaya. So, that is also a very good statement by our chairman in today's another department meeting, sir. So, that is what every shareholder would deserve that your product should be available in each and every nook and corner. As other Hindus can only live products, we can see in every country. Similarly, our product should also reach across and show that we just every nook and partner, sir. And most of my questions, I have already sent my email also, I should not repeat the same questions again in the interest of time. And the company has a good property on its practice. I do appreciate the management for that, sir. I wish the company and the board of directors a great success and prosperity in the coming future. And thank you for giving the opportunity, sir. Hope to see you in the hybrid AGM next year. And also kindly send your product samples as your status. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, let me check. Yes, we are also looking into the next year. I think we should be able to do a hybrid and wherever possible, you know, everybody. See, this is one day, generally what happens is because of a lot of restrictions on factory visit. That's one of the things we always keep ourselves. So one day on the AGM day, we used to allow. So there is always a possibility. Any specific request, somebody is there. If you tell us, all shareholders will be allowed, there is no restriction on that. But you have to tell us in advance because there are a lot of issues when, you know, people walk into the shareholders, that's into the company. That's the only reason. Otherwise, whatever suggestions you have done, we will always be forthcoming. And there is no issue at all. Thank you, Abhishek. Next speaker, share holder. Shippee, Gopan.
